      "body": "Don'tcha just love \"suicidal ideation\" as a common side effect of your anti-depressant?\n\nWhile there may be no quantifiable link between serotonin and mood, do you wanna know what serotonin is *definitely* linked to? LSD.\n\nDo you wanna know what has wildly unpredictable and polar-opposite effects on mood, depending on un-quantifiable underlying psychological factors?\n\nLSD and SSRIs.\n\nIts seems that, by changing ones mental configuration, the placebo effect does the rest. If the placebo effect is powerful in physical illness, it appears at least doubly so in mental illness. This little caveat has been (for decades) and continues to be exploited by Big Pharma for profit, bringing about the generational pseudo-science of psychiatry -- an ultimately illogical and demonstrably un-scientific house of cards that will be looked upon by more advanced generations as having as much legitimacy as phrenology or astrology. \n\nFor better or worse, the primacy of the Mind and its vast potential for self-definition as a sovereign entity, outside the stifling and nonsensical bounds of \"chemical balance,\" reclaims its throne.\n\nQuotes from the article:\n\n\"The major new umbrella review – an overview of existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews – was published on July 20 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. It suggests that depression is not likely caused by a chemical imbalance, and calls into question what antidepressant medications do.\"\n\n“Many people take antidepressants because they have been led to believe their depression has a biochemical cause, but this new research suggests this belief is not grounded in evidence.”\n\n\"There is also evidence that believing that low mood is caused by a chemical imbalance leads people to have a pessimistic outlook on the likelihood of recovery, and the possibility of managing moods without medical help. This is important because most people will meet criteria for anxiety or depression at some point in their lives.\"",

This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience disturbed sleep and night terrors more often than people who don't have tinnitus.\n\nTinnitus patients also spend more time in light sleep. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.\n\nIn future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity.",

      "body": "Why does it seem that the entire premise of therapy is overwhelmingly centered on preventing suicide?\n\nIt strikes me that there's a lack of acknowledgment for the perspective that, for some individuals, the desire to exit this life might be a considered and steadfast viewpoint.\n\nCertainly, there are instances where feelings of wanting to end one's life are fleeting or influenced by transient challenges such as financial difficulties. The prevailing wisdom suggests that with time and support, these feelings may pass.\n\nHowever, what about the scenario where an individual genuinely finds life unendurable, not due to acute crises but as a fundamental assessment of their existence? Every person is thrust into life without a say, and upon evaluating their experiences and the nature of existence, some might conclusively decide that it's not for them.\n\nThe question arises: should there be space within our societal and therapeutic frameworks to validate and discuss these feelings without the immediate jump to suicide prevention strategies? Isn't there merit to considering the depth and nuance of such a stance, especially in a world where autonomy and personal choice are highly valued in other contexts?\n\nEdit to bring attention to this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/1bjuc72/comment/kvuosn2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nEdit to [steal the line](https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/1bjuc72/comment/kvw88p9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) \"Life is a gift that nobody asks for, and so, in return, I think it should be free to refuse\".",

Genetic predisposition makes sense, but do disorders ever be purely genetic like that? While looking this up, I came across some (questionable) sources claiming that they may have a severe genetic predisposition may make them so susceptible to smaller adversities that they develop the disorder, but I'm a bit sceptical of that because the sources are rather \"pop-psychy\" and I haven't been able to find scientific articles that give that idea any credence. I know of the biosocial theory, and if I've understood correctly, it requires environmental factors along with heightened emotional sensitivity, but what the environment is stable and supportive?

However, recently I saw a totally different interpretation. The kids who ate the marshmallow were poorer than kids who didn't, hence why they struggled not to eat it. Not that they were hungry at that same moment, but they didn't eat sweets as much as richer kids, so they had harder time resisting. The richer kids were more successful because success is correlated with how rich your family is.\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle between these two interpretations.

Would he be capable of self-pity ? Feeling sad about his situation ? Longing for something better ? My character is supposed to have a complicated family, would he be able to wish he had a nice family, or would he just not care ? I ran several research regarding those but the answers were mixed, a lot of people said that psychopaths can feel negative emotions when the situation impacts them personally, while others said that no, psychopaths have a total lack of emotions.\n\nI'd love answers, maybe with source so I can check some stuff myself too ! I really want to write him correctly, psychology is super interesting and it's so sad to see some people just flagging a pathology as something simple (and sometimes false) when in reality it's so complex...\n\nThanks people for your help <3",

([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_bonding) and elsewhere).\n\nUsing \"trauma bonding\" to mean bonding through shared trauma makes much more intuitive sense to me than the other way, but I'm really just looking for whatever term exists to describe it. For example, people who survive a kidnapping together, children who survive abusive parents, etc. Is there a term for that?",

Because this didn't sit right with me, I tried to research this author to find out her credentials. All I could find was a sparse website that didn't even include a CV or the name of the school awarding her PhD, and a twitter page that didn't seem to be related to psychology in any way.\n\nAlso, as someone planning to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology, I was under the impression that you would need to publish several peer-reviewed articles to receive a PhD. However, I cannot find any evidence that this person has been published in any peer-reviewed journals, and I cannot even find where she supposedly received her PhD from.\n\nDoes anyone know if she has published any papers that I could read? I am concerned about the idea that the NYTimes would not check her credentials and allow her to publish without fact-checking her story. Generally, the academics I've seen writing for large publications like NYT would provide more information about the research they have been involved in.",

      "body": "Considering that personality is enduring across a person's lifetime and across situations.\n\nFor example, depression lowers motivation, which is very similar to having low conscientiousness and introversion (motivation to socialise). Or PTSD could increase agreeableness, due to the subject's fear of their previous traumatic incident repeating (eg a person who was randomly assaulted being careful not to anger others, because at the back of their mind they perceive a potential threat). What if a person never divulges their trauma or their trauma isn't recognised (such as in societies where mental health is less acknowledged) - their agreeableness could be perceived as a personality trait, when it's partially caused by PTSD. So how do psychologists determine to what extent a trait is due to mental illness or due to \"personality\"? \n\nLikewise, how do you know that a person's personality won't change when you put them in another environment? For example, how do you know that an extroverted, disagreeable person in a free, safe society won't become introverted and agreeable if betrayed by their loved ones and tortured in prison?   How do you know that a child who is disagreeable won't become situationally agreeable if placed with violent parents? Or that a disagreeable, low conscientiousness single person won't increase both those traits if they have a family to care for? Until they're placed in different situations, how can you know whether their \"personality\" will endure?\n\nThere was the study in that German village (Marienthal) where unemployment was rife and people's levels of different personality traits changed - so can this be considered personality, if it changed, even though \"personality\" is supposed to endure across situations and across a person's lifetime.\n\nIs it just a case of assuming it's personality if a cure or change hasn't yet happened, for that one individual in their lifetime? Personality disorders are considered to be \"personality\", because they're permanent - but if a person is cured of a personality disorder, would you retroactively say it was incorrect to call it their \"personality\"?",

It seems like this diagnosis is given disproportionately to woman whom, if they were men, could very likely have been diagnosed with something else (autism, for instance). Woman who are given this diagnosis are often written off by professionals, not only mental health professionals but others like - if a woman with BPD reports abuse, it's more likely police will see the bpd diagnosis as a way to dismiss her claims.\n\nMy second problem is how nebulous and vague the criteria are. It's like \"everything and nothing in particular\" at the same time. I have read online that there are experts who see some dissociative disorders as BPD. Personally, I see BPD as closer to something like CPTSD than a dissociative disorder's similarity to BPD. When I think about throwing dissociation in general in the same diagnosis  as BPD I am simply baffled. I get that it can also be a trauma disorder but there is so much more that doesn't overlap than does.\n\nMy last issue: BPD is given to people simply because they are seen as \"difficult\" by some professionals. My insurance once suggested I was BPD and was \"gaming treatment\" because I ask a lot of questions and state my opinions. I have never once had a real BPD diagnosis, but it seems to be thrown at people who piss a practitioner off. \n\nI do think that BPD has genuinely afflicted persons, but I think the stigma, misuse, and catchall status is frankly harmful and I'm wondering how professionals out there feel about giving this diagnosis to their patients or treating those that have this diagnosis on their chart.",

The therapists had an emphasis on men's issues, and OP's question had to do with whether \"men's issues\" is a red flag when dealing with a therapist. In other words, is \"men's issues\" a legitimate focus/emphasis, or is it a dog whistle?\n\nMy therapist is super progressive, and among other things, her Psychology Today profiles includes \"men's issues\" as a focus (as well as \"women's issues\"). So after defending men's issues as a legitimate concept (but not as a diagnosable condition), I was perma-banned from the feminism sub. To be fair, in one of my comments I admitted I had done 0 research into it, and making uninformed comments goes against one of their rules. Aside from that, the mods' justification was that men's issues is a right-wing dog whistle, and I was supporting/defending it.\n\nI'm aware that \"men's rights\" is often contentious, but this was the first time I've heard anyone outside of a therapy setting mention \"men's issues,\" much less delegitimize it as a valid concept.\n\nWhat do you think? Maybe \"men's issues\" is a layperson kind of thing but not something a psychologist would actually focus on outside of trying to market themselves and get new patients?",

      "body": "I am by no means a professional or anything, but here is my perspective as a biology student taking some intro psych courses.\n\nMy textbook seems to suggest the percentage of the population with mental illnesses could be as high as even 50%. I'm wondering if, at that point, is it even \"atypical\" to have \"atypical\" tendencies? Hypothetically could these really just be different personality types? I understand that it would be different disorders stemming from trauma, but when other disorders are seeming to be more and more related to genetics and biology it just makes me wonder if it's less a disorder and more just different ways of percieving the world, the same way we all have our own consciousness. That being said, I know a lot of physical disorders are genetic also so I'm not sure where the line is.\n\nI'm wondering why some people technically have a disorder as categorized by a book when it could be percieved it as just a different way of thinking. I think that if it wasn't classified as a disorder, then someone could say \"Hey I have autism\" the same way other people say \"Hey I'm an extrovert\". I feel like there's so much more stigma surrounding it because it's classified as if there's something wrong. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that with so many disorders and so many blurry lines and overlapping between some, why does it seem a lot of it could be described with personality instead? Why does the chapter I've done on personality seem so lacking compared to the chapter on psychological disorders?\n\nPlease excuse any misuse of terminology or lack of understanding, I would love to be corrected where it's needed. \n\nPlease give links if this has been discussed anywhere too!\n\nTL;DR: disorder vs personality?",

But in their early twenties, they realize that they want to get better, so they stop self harming and get sober. Their life improves dramatically, to the point where they can have normal relationships and don't have emotional crises anymore. They almost certainly wouldn't meet the diagnostic criteria anymore.\n\nAll that without real therapy, just their own will to get better.\n\nThis is based on this story I read online. To me, it sounds like the diagnosis must have been wrong, because a personality disorder is supposed to be stable over a lifetime.\n\nYes, you can go into remission with something like DBT, but just through your own willpower, in your early twenties? That would be impossible, right? Or can this happen?",

      "body": "I’ve heard it said many times by more qualified psychologists that the Myers Briggs classification system is ‘nonsense’ or the ‘astrology of psychology’ and other such derisive terms. I understand that certain tests designed to tell you your type may not be well designed, but I’m unclear as to why the classification system itself (I/E, N/S etc) is also considered so poorly? \n\nAstrology for example is attributing certain attributes to certain causes, so I can see how a research base that it clearly lacks would be necessary. However, the Myers Briggs system seems to instead simply just be a terminology for labelling common observations and traits, so I’m unsure as to what research base if any it would even need in the first place?\n\nEdit: to clarify this post is more aimed at the actual classification system rather than any individual test designed to attribute one of said classifications to someone\n\nEdit 2: Having read the responses  I think a significant part of the disagreements arise from the fact that it seems I am approaching this with a different set of assumptions to academia. When I talk about the usefulness of the MBTI classifications, I do so in the context of being able to quickly and effectively communicate key personality traits in a non absolute easy to understand manner for more informal purposes, rather than to draw more significant conclusions. In contrast it seems that the psychology community desires more easily measurable and less ‘subjective’ means of quantifying certain traits such that more significant conclusions can be formed. In this way I can see how the MBTI falls short, even if I still maintain it is not as useless as a perspective entirely viewed through that lens implies",

And its really frustrating to me. How do you deal with people who take a genuine field of study, which is trying to be used to HELP other people, and just throw it out as \"psychobabble\".

Then, one of the most obvious solutions to this is to ask close people to help remember their history, but what if these close people don't remember either or didn't have any observations for reasons such as the patient hiding their symptoms back then or building coping strategies that make their symptoms unnoticeable?\n\nThe patient could forget their past symptoms if they has been unaware of them for a very long time, so they didn't really care or pay attention because they thought it's normal and they only have memories of recent experiences when they finally were informed that something might be wrong.

It's like: today one worries about his job, tomorrow it's depression about the future, next day are worries about health and possibly having a disesase, day after that it's getting into arguments with friends, next day maybe having intrusive thoughts. Does that person indeed have depression, anxiety, hypohodrisasis, and an OCD all together at the same time or is that person \"simply\" neurotic which makes them messed up and all over the place (instable, that is), so that they constantly oscillate between these distressing emotional states?\n\nEspecially considering that there is an objective trait to one's psyche called \"Neuroticism\", which meanse exactly that. Is it possible that these \"old school\" psychiatrists actually got it right in a sense that yes, neurosis is a vague diagnosis, but it also accurately describes some people, moreso that separate comorbid states?\n\nEnlighten me please, does this make sense?\n\nI admit I'm like that.

George Boeree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._George_Boeree)*, professor emeritus at* [*Shippensburg University*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippensburg_University_of_Pennsylvania)*, the symptoms of neurosis may involve:*\n\n>*...* [*anxiety*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety)*, sadness or* [*depression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)*,* [*anger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger)*, irritability, mental confusion, low sense of self-worth, etc., behavioral symptoms such as phobic avoidance, vigilance, impulsive and compulsive acts, lethargy, etc., cognitive problems such as unpleasant or disturbing thoughts, repetition of thoughts and* [*obsession*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder)*, habitual fantasizing, negativity and cynicism, etc. Interpersonally, neurosis involves dependency, aggressiveness,* [*perfectionism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology))*, schizoid isolation, socio-culturally inappropriate behaviors, etc.*[*\\[1\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis#cite_note-Boeree2002-1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: There's the same post in r/metalhealth, I posted it there too to gain a broader audience. Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fhxq8j/why\\_is\\_neurosis\\_considered\\_an\\_outdated\\_diagnosis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fhxq8j/why_is_neurosis_considered_an_outdated_diagnosis/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks for all the answers, I really appreciate it.

I can't wait to learn more from all of you an spread the amazing and interesting aspects of the area of study with the world :)\n\nSo almost everyone I have ever met from every imaginable background brightens up and is totally alive and energetic when they talk about all the mind boggling aspects of reality.\n\nThings like how the universe started so infinitesimally small and now is so massive and contains all this diversity.\n\nThings like the famous \"Smallest to Largest Comparison in the Universe\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f_M26S4tPY\n\nPhilosophy of mind - How material things like skin, central nervous system, brain, etc. can give rise to immaterial (qualia) things like feelings, emotions, consciousness, etc.\n\nHow words and concepts can create logical problems that are near unsolvable because those words and concepts are themselves geared towards a linguistic sense and not a philosophical sense.\n\nHow things like color, taste, and other phenomenal reality do not exist independent but are an interaction of systems. (The profoundness of how changes in reality can create whole new dimensions of reality).\n\nSo within Psychology what are some things you have learned that you always go back to as the \"BIG\" mind boogling things you have learned and love thinking about :)?",

Most of the things I have read about relationships involving an avoidant person don't really give them much representation and treat them only peripherally.\n\nI get the sense that most of the material about avoidant attachment style has been written by non-avoidant people who are doing guesswork about what is going on for the avoidant person. A lot of it seems unsympathetic and even malicious when it goes in depth about their thoughts and motivations.\n\nI would like to talk about these attachment styles with my partner, but I don't feel comfortable doing so when I only have reading material that describes them as bad actors, often in black and white terms.\n\nDoes anyone know of anything about avoidant people or the avoidant attachment style that was written by someone who identifies or identified as avoidant?\n\nOr, alternatively, another similar theory that more accurately describes what \"avoidant attachment style\" is attempting to describe?\n\nMany thanks in advance.

They may have good financial situation, they may be rich, inherite lot of property, have good job, lot of people around who care about them. But despite of how their life is good, they are miserly, ungratefull and negative. It is like nothing can not make them be positive. This people also hold grudges, and staying in victim mentality for eternity. When something bad happen to them, they never move out and complain for decades of years. They are never gratefull for nothing, they may have good health, lot of money or people who care about them, but they are not gratefull for it. They would find even disadvantage in having lot of money or having good health.\n\nSome people experience same amount of problems in life, or hundred times worse. Some people have nothing just a piece of bread in a day, but they remain positive hoping for better future.\n\nWhy?",

      "body": "Hi!\n\nI’ve always been someone who naturally communicates with non verbal cues. And I’m interested to know more about why myself and other people may have this tendency?\n\nFor example, imagine a person having a conversation with someone. Lets say the other person brings something up that they don’t feel comfortable discussing. The first persons automatic response might be to disengage and become silent, with the intention being to communicate to the other person that they don’t want to discuss the topic in question. However, the other person very well may not pick up on this at all.\n\nWhen I have spoken to others about this phenomena I’ve noticed some people who also tend to rely on non verbal cues for communication, and on the other hand, I have noticed many people who can only properly understand direct verbal communication and can’t pick up on non verbal cues?\n\nI’m sorry if this is a messy question, I suppose what I’m asking is: Is there a reason, that we know of, that some people tend to lean towards communicating non verbally while others aren’t able to do this?  If so, do you think this is to do with nature or nurture or a mix of the two?",

Most don't even accept *any* insurance. I totally get why. I get that people can't really afford to accept some insurances, and that psychologists have student loans, families to take care of, and bills to pay.\n\nBut, genuinely, what are poor people supposed to do?  Sliding scale always means at least $100/hr, but usually more. I've worked with some LCSW/LMSWs who accept my insurance and honestly, it seems like people who accept Medicaid are... maybe not the best? Or maybe I've had some bad luck. I asked my current therapist (LCSW) for tools to navigate and deal with some irrational fear/anxiety behaviors I've had since childhood and they literally said, \"Wow, I'm not sure what we can do about that\". And that was after I insisted on explaining what I meant regarding the behavior, because their original answer when I broached the topic was \"everyone does that\". I'm not sure if master's-level counseling really only teaches about talk therapy, but I really want (need?) some actionable tools/ways to work on myself.\n\nMy partner has had the same experience with therapists in NYC, but her PhD-holding psych in another city was amazing and gave her all of these tangible tools and it really helped her to change her whole life. Are poor people just... not able to get real help? Is there a way to do that that doesn't basically require the therapist to work for free/very little? Am I missing something? Is there something I should be looking for specifically when choosing a LCSW?\n\nMy apologies if this isn't the right place for this, feel free to point me in the right direction!",

They are winning so often, that statistically speaking it is tremendously unlikely.\n\nIt made me think that perhaps the fact that they are winning is making them win more often, because of the feeling that they have \"an angel on their shoulder\" or \"luck on their side\".\n\nIf such an effect exists it would be a good explanation for this situation.\n\nI am reminded of Ron in Harry Potter who thought he had taken some felix felices (a good luck potion), when in fact he hadn't. He did very well in his quidditch match because of the confidence it gave him. The same thing happens, I imagine, to people who win a few times and start thinking there must be some supernatural force making them win all the time, making them confident, so that they do, in fact, keep winning.\n\nI'm using the word \"effect\" because I would think it might be a behavioural effect like the Hawthorne effect, the effect that subjects of a study change their behaviour because they know they are part of a study.",

Naturally, subjects like biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and physics are at the top of people's list when it comes to what they want to study for these future careers. However, there is an unstated, but very obvious attitude that psychology does not belong in that group. \n\nYou can see this in government too where most of the funding prioritizes these previously stated areas and ignore psychology who I think contributes just as much if not more. Counseling and therapies are vital as mental health issues are on the rise. Research on love and glee are some examples that show how psychologists are changing the world. Recently, I've been enamored by research investigating the neuroscience of self-perception and self-regulation. There's even research looking at animal personality. In my humble opinion, this is where the future is at, and I'm not just talking about the future of psychology. Who cares what's out there in the cosmos when we can be learning about things right inside and in front of us. \n\nFinally, not sure if this is related, but I noticed most people who end up majoring in psychology are girls. Why is that? Find any research lab website and look for lab member photos. It's pretty clear that women pursue this major during both undergrad and grad schools. Where are the guys? What do you think it tell us? Statistically, guys seem to go into the more respected majors too. I would like to see equal representations here.\n\nAnyway, I would love to live in a world where people would not look down their noses at those who do this work.",

I was wondering how Psychologists in general perceive him/his works. Cass Eris, a Cognitive Psychology YouTuber has been covering him polemically. Her basic point, from what I understand, is that JP uses an outdated form of Psychology, probably called 'Jungian Psychology' iirc, and sometimes uses badly conducted studies. Do you guys agree?

      "title": "Hot Take: The names of disorders are all wrong",
      "body": "TLDR: Mental Disorders are currently categorized and labeled according to observation of behavioral symptoms. They should instead be categorized and labeled according to the actual neural pathway they are affecting. This would make mental disorders both more empirical and more medically actionable.\n\nThis is just my hot take, my opinion. Feel free to disagree with me civilly.\n\nOkay, so this idea has been stewing for a little bit. When you open the DSM-V, you might find something with a name like \"Major Depressive Disorder\", \"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\", or \"Bipolar Disorder\".\n\nNow, here's my issue. These names describe behavioral symptoms. That might make sense intuitively, but it just doesn't make sense medically.\n\nIf someone was in a cold sweat, collapsed, screaming about chest pain and shortness of breath, we wouldn't look at them and say: \"Oh, they have Chest Hurting Disorder\". No, we would diagnose the problem and name it for what it IS and IS AFFECTING, i.e. \"They're having a HEART ATTACK.\"\n\nStay with me now. How does it make any sense at all to categorize mental illnesses by what they look like to a casual observer, rather than what they are in reality (think SKIN cancer, BACK pain, CARPAL TUNNEL syndrome).\n\nThese labels are critical in indicating what is actually going wrong and very much shapes our understanding of how they should be treated.\n\nTake Major Depressive Disorder for example. The DSM-V Criteria for Major Depressive Order are:\n\n> 1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).\n\n> 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.\n\n> 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.\n\n> 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n\n> 5. Psychomotor agitation or r*tardation (apparently reddit makes you censor this word LOL) nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).\n\n> 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n\n> 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day.\n\n> 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.\n\n> 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\n\nNotice how none of these criteria, nor the actual name of the Disorder itself, actually helps us understand what is happening at the causal level? Nor do these criteria lend to any real, practical solution, since none of them name anything within the body that we would be able to aim a cure (or preventive treatment) at! (remember? HEART attack?)\n\nIf you still don't see how this could be problematic, I'll raise you this: Schizophrenia used to be known as \"Dementia Praecox\", literally meaning \"early dementia\". People really saw these two wildly different mental disorders and thought they were the same thing because they were categorizing based on external, behavioral observations. It was only developments in neurobiology that helped us better understand what was really happening, thus getting one step closer to being able to do something about the problem.\n\nSo, my thesis is this: Disorders should be named and diagnostic criteria based on the neurobiological reality of what is happening, not based on behavioral observation. For example, OCD should be called something like \"Thalamic Hyperactivation Disorder\" (Take that with a grain of salt, but I hope you get my point). Not only does this bring mental health diagnosis and treatment more in line with the modern standard of medicine, it also allows us to use much less subjective metrics for diagnosis. We are currently taking what we see and trying to extrapolate backwards to name/guess a cause. It is more scientific and effective to take a brain scan, blood work, and family genetic data, then use it to create a comprehensive analysis of what is actually wrong.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for raising some very good points. This has been very illuminating. For something like \"back pain\", some of you have pointed out that the actual pathogenesis of such conditions is sometimes less physical and more mental. This is a good point! Maybe we shouldn't call it back pain either.\n\nI believe that no matter what ails us, mind or body, we should aim to target the most basic cause as high up on the causal chain as possible.\n\nSome of you also pointed out that there are, more often that not, ultimate causes outside of the brain and body that eventually manifest as these things we call disorders. This is also a good point. That being said, this is exactly what my issue is; such cases should be treated as the sociological issues they are, rather than reduced to individual medical issues or even moral failings. \n\nWestern individualistic philosophy and medicine has done a lot of harm to us all, but I hope conversations like this will one day contribute towards a more holistic, empirical, and most importantly, effective mental health model.\n\nEdit 2: Phew! Looks like this post is really striking a chord. Thank you to everyone who agreed and disagreed respectfully, as I requested. However, to those of you who are blatantly or (not so) subtly attacking me, please reflect on yourself. If you wouldn't speak a certain way to someone's face, don't do it here either.",

      "title": "Why are personality disorders and the DSM considered scientific when they're based almost entirely on subjective and culturally defined criteria?",
      "body": "I was reading through some lectures today for one of my classes and came upon a couple of personality disorders. The clinical markers/definitions for them had me contemplate this question. \n\nFor schizoid personality disorder, they noted that characteristics include \"preferring to be alone\" and \"not valuing interpersonal relationships\". This does not directly have a negative impact on this person's life (i.e. cause dysfunction) UNLESS you factor in the societal perception and reaction to said individual. For schizotypal disorder the clinical markers include having \"odd ideas/beliefs\" and \"behaving/dressing strangely\"...that has to be some of the most subjective/relative criteria I've ever heard. And again, how does this negatively impact that individual's life if you don't factor in the societal/cultural expectation component? By this same logic, someone who is defined as mentally healthy today could very easily be defined as mentally ill in another time period or region of the world simply because they do not conform to the societal norms/expectations of that era or location. Being homosexual could be defined as a disorder relative to your culture because you could argue it causes you significant distress and dysfunction in your life when mainstream society regularly treats you poorly and rejects you, thereby causing an internalization of hatred of your sexual identity.\n\nAnd look, I'm not saying there aren't general patterns of different personality types that tend to have similar presenting features. I think from a broad categorization standpoint it can be useful to have a general idea of what types of traits tend to cluster together to form personality groups which gives a basis for different treatment modalities to assist those who are unhappy or struggling with specific, recurrent issues. But I find myself scratching my head at how much of our basis on these disorders is reliant upon subjective data. Even brain scans are highly limited in what they can tell us. Sure, you can measure electrical activity and see how \"healthy\" brains fire relative to \"unhealthy\" brains (which again is entirely subjective; why does a different electrical pattern in a brain imply it is inherently unhealthy?), but the true mechanisms of neurotransmitters and their proper functional levels still have no way of realistically being measured so instead scientists just broadly speculate about brain health and disorders using vague electrical brain wave pattern data.\n\nAll of this to say, I think there will be a point where psychology will have the ability to objectively measure and understand the brain and it's functions while interlinking it to the subjective data we currently use as a basis for most of our understanding and treatment of mental health. But the current guidelines that exist to assess, diagnose, and treat mental \"illness\" seem to overreach quite a bit given the level of actual understanding and again, rely HEAVILY on cultural/subjectively-defined criteria. It's not the inherent study of the mind and its dysfunction that is pseudoscientific, but the practice as it currently stands today definitely seems to be imo.\n\n**TL;DR:** Some disorders seem genuinely based on a dysfunction of the brain whereas others seem to be based on whether or not someone's behaviors/thoughts have a negative impact on their lives as defined by their relationship to society and it's cultural norms. Either way, we currently have very little means to objectively confirm the basis of these assertions and yet we seemingly reach far beyond our current objective understanding of the brain/mind in how we assess, diagnose, and treat mental health disorders.\n\n**EDIT:** I would just like to say I appreciate all of the thoughtful and detailed responses. I never imagined I'd get so much insightful discourse so I'm grateful! I've certainly got a lot to chew on from all of the perspectives contributed to this thread. Thank you!",

      "title": "The case for CPTSD As A New Diagnosis for the DSM",
      "body": "While the DSM V rejected a CPTSD diagnosis, a case should be made for the inclusion of CPTSD in the DSM VI. While almost everyone has heard of PTSD, CPTSD is differentiated from PTSD in that the trauma usually took place in childhood, over an extended period of time as opposed to the oftentimes abrupt nature of trauma seen in PTSD. CPTSD includes many of the symptoms of PTSD, but with additional adverse components related to self-concept, cognition, emotional affect, and attachment. CPTSD also does not include flashbacks, at least not in the same way that PTSD does, therefore we also see the absence of certain symptoms in CPTSD that are present in PTSD. While the CPTSD movement failed with the DSM-IV and DSM-V, the ICD-11 has recently included CPTSD in its classification of mental health disorders.\n\nA researcher at Duke, Patricia Resick, was a large factor in the rejection of CPTSD by the American mental health system. Resick argued that CPTSD was not statistically distinct enough from PTSD and perhaps BPD. However, it should be highlighted that many psychological disorders have large overlaps and comorbidities with other disorders. Resick’s analysis has largely come under criticism from researchers such as Judith Herman at Harvard, who highlight the lack of research to go off of in Resick’s paper. Herman also proposes that a step forward might be to recognize CPTSD as a subtype of PTSD, but ultimately that CPTSD itself is a distinct entity that must be recognized for research purposes and to the benefit of individuals with trauma histories. While America has failed to recognize CPTSD, Europe is accumulating a literature of CPTSD on its own accord.\n\nA very important idea with the CPTSD diagnosis, is that the trauma is interpersonal in nature. Even a sustained series of natural disasters, while highly unlikely, would theoretically not lead to a CPTSD diagnosis. The additional impairment with CPTSD, is largely related to a disconnect with others as a result of sustained interpersonal trauma (Ben-Ezra et al. 2018). As Ben-Ezra’s team in Israel notes, 17 out of 19 studies examining the construct validity of CPTSD have supported its distinction from PTSD through six symptom clusters as opposed to PTSD’s three symptom clusters. Prevalence rate of 9.0% was found for PTSD and 2.6% for CPTSD. The team concluded that the research supports the discriminant validity of a CPTSD diagnosis.\n\nThe ACE study done by Kaiser is another well done and well known study of the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences on later health/life outcomes. The ACE study found that four adverse childhood experiences increased the chances for depression by a factor of four to twelve, as well as alcoholism, drug abuse, and suicide attempts (Felitti et al. 1998). CPTSD puts a spotlight on the issue of childhood trauma, and highlights the symptoms that come with childhood abuse and neglect. Perhaps then, it is no surprise that it has overlap with disorders such as MDD, BPD, and anxiety disorders.\n\nIt might also be highlighted that some of those with trauma histories, including mental health professionals, have adopted CPTSD despite the DSM’s rejection. The CPTSD subreddit has 88.1K subscribers, and other communities have popped up as well such as Out of The Fog and The CPTSD Foundation. While this doesn’t say much scientifically, it does suggest that many are already finding this construct helpful (or at least they believe that it is a helpful construct). This absolutely suggests a need for research in this area. Furthermore, some research already suggests the validity of the CPTSD diagnosis, culminating in the inclusion of CPTSD in the ICD-11. This research as well as the criticisms of Resick, all lead me to support the inclusion of CPTSD in the DSM-VI.",

      "body": "Louann Brizendine’s bestselling books *The Male Brain* and *The Female Brain* both contain various false (and degrading) claims about male sexuality and the male sex drive. Judging by her claims and writing style, it seems that Brizendine enjoys the idea that men are carnal, perverted animals but women are conversely more “superior” when it comes to sex and have a more “superior” sexuality.  \n\nHere’s a [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/443634a) for *The Female Brain* by the scientific journal Nature: \n***Yet, despite the author's extensive academic credentials, The Female Brain disappointingly fails to meet even the most basic standards of scientific accuracy and balance. The book is riddled with scientific errors and is misleading about the processes of brain development, the neuroendocrine system, and the nature of sex differences in general.***\n\nHere are the claims Brizendine’s books make: \n\n• **The part of the brain responsible for sexual pursuit is 2.5 times larger in men than women.** This claim is bullshit, since Brizendine doesn’t even mention what part of the brain this is (or what she specifically means by “sexual pursuit area”) as a neuropsychologist mentions [in this article.](https://talyarkoni.org/blog/2010/03/24/the-male-brain-hurts-or-how-not-to-write-about-science/)\n\n• **85% of men aged from 22 to 30 think of sex every 52 seconds, whereas women only think of sex once a day and maybe 3 or 4 times a day on their most fertile days.** This is a delusional lie. None of the sources she cites even *mention* the frequency at which women and men think about sex, as [this article proves.](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003668.html) **This is something Brizendine has been repeatedly criticized for.** The article also demonstrates that the discrepancy between how often women and men think about sex isn’t nearly as profound. \n\n• **Thoughts about sex enter a man’s mind every single minute, but enter as woman’s brain every few days. Men seize any sexual opportunity they can get.** Again, this is utter horseshit. None of her sources even remotely corroborate this ridiculous claim and there are many that debunk it. \n\n• **Men’s brain space for sex is like O’Hare airport, while women’s is like a small airfield. Whereas women’s emotional processing is like a superhighway, men’s like a dirt road.** All Brizendine is doing is falsely claiming that while men are horny sex animals, women are conversely not carnally inclined and much more emotionally and mentally inclined. It’s as if she’s saying women are “superior” or more “mature” than men, who apparently aren’t in tune with emotions and just yearn for carnal pleasure. And once again, she doesn’t even specify what specific parts of the brain are at play here. \n\n\n• **Men can’t help being distracted by female body parts and get stuck in a trance at the sight of breasts.** Yeah, this is just an unnecessarily dumb way of saying men are attracted to breasts. Brizendine doesn’t seem to think women ogle at attractive men, though, and even suggests that women can’t fathom being visually stimulated. \n\n\n• **Foreplay for men is just a few minutes, but for women it’s a few days. Women’s libidos are impacted by emotions and what goes on around her, but men’s aren’t.** Once again, this is ridiculous. Men’s libidos are *absolutely* impacted by various external factors such as our emotions, our moods, stress, etc. \n\nThe books frequently invoke the “boys will be boys” trope and that men can’t help being salacious or perverted because it’s our “nature.” Additionally, [this article](https://baremarriage.com/2021/10/christian-authors-using-junk-science-about-gender-differences/) by Sheila Wray Gregoire does a good job of demonstrating how Brizendine’s lies have fueled purity culture and the false beliefs of male sexuality that we find in evangelical Christian books and social circles.",

      "body": "So, I have been studying psychology for about six years now, from 11th Grade all the way through my undergraduate. Of this, three years were spent studying psychology in India, and the next three years were spent studying it in Canada. One of the concepts we were taught in India (and in a few third year courses in Canada), was the idea of psychology being \"W.E.I.R.D\" (most psychological research being done in Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries/ or using WEIRD perspectives on non-western countries). I felt this a lot of times in during uni in Canada, but often questioned if my knowledge of academia wasn't deep enough/'I just didn't understand' etc etc... However,  the way third world countries & populations were desribed in academia and courses seemed to be outdated. Sometimes I felt that professors tiptoed around this (for example: not properly addressing gaps in Western research, not redirecting students to the right resources to look for non-western academia etc..) I understand that the way you study a subject like psychology is usualy in relation to the country that you are studying it in. But one of they key differences I felt between Indian vs. Canadian education systems was that when I was studying in India, we were constantly thinking about psychological concepts in relation to culture. In Canada, culture was usually assigned its own chapter and that was pretty much it. These are just my experiences as a student, I am yet to gain more professional experience.\n\nSo, for psychologists in non-western countries, have you felt this too? How does one go about decolonizing their understanding of psychology, while actively participating in academia/pursuing a career in psychology?\n\nEdit: Just added a little blurb",

Hope this is ok to post here, if not I suppose the mods will remove it.\n\nLast time I posted, I was asking about some remarks made by my therapist about the DSM. When I explained that I was raised in a religious community, that my therapist is a devout member of said community, and that my t was criticizing the DSM in the context of a larger attempt to discredit modern medical science and research as part of a defense of the religion, many here urged me to look for a new therapist.\n\nI began looking for a new, secular provider by contacting several other therapists from my religious community, as although I am now looking for a secular therapist, I figured that they would know who I should go to, as the religious trauma I am working through requires a good knowledge of both my religion and religious culture, something hard to find in someone secular.\n\nI was pleased and somewhat pleasantly surprised to find that the religious therapists I reached out to were more than happy to help me network to find someone secular who fit my needs, even offering to speak with me free if charge so they could get a good sense of what I'm looking for.\n\nWhat I thought this subreddit would find particularly interesting is that when I mentioned the reason why I am looking for a new therapist, the religious therapist I was speaking to expressed shock at how my first therapist has allowed his religious bias and opinions to dominate, or even to filter in at all to, our discussion. \n\nTo give a rough quote, 'I don't want to criticize your therapist, but what you're describing is definitely not something I would typically expect a therapist to do- a therapist should never be pushing you to make any decision at all, and certainly not about whether or not to stay religious, and he certainly shouldn't be voicing his own opinions about homosexuality.'\n\nSo if even the other religious therapists think my guy crossed a line, and felt the need to tell me so, it seems that this subreddit was on to something.\n\nSo thank you all for the heads up.",

Having read some of the research, I'm agnostic:\n\n* The very [researchers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207148408416004) who coined the term 'Multiple Personality Disorder' later argued that, after seeing 1000s of alleged MPD cases, they suspect it doesn't exist, BUT\n* A DID patient showed [different EEG patterns](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1954-07757-001) for different alters, BUT\n* EEG is [sensitive to mood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051110002553) more so than individual differences, so that's not strong evidence, BUT\n* At the end of the day, therapists need to [listen to and respect](https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/90/5/803/2737901) their clients, so if their clients' lived experience is that of someone with alter identities then they must respect that, BUT\n* There's a real fear that DID is [iatrogenic](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009318539902700308) (physician-induced), meaning therapists are sometimes *causing* people to develop memories of assault and identity splitting which is horrific, BUT\n* The term \"[flashback](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/fc9430fb-a282-491d-974e-90f08bea0452)\" was invented for movies but has found use in describing a real experience of PTSD, which means a term can be both culture-bound and therapeutic, BUT\n* Classical conditioning [transfers between alters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796704000518), suggesting that reports of amnesia aren't entirely accurate, BUT\n* Even H.M. could be classically [conditioned](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-30461-001) with enough trials, so conditioning might be procedural not declarative, BUT\n* Our understanding of DID is based in the since-debunked [repressed memory theory](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658211.2018.1532521), BUT...\n\n**Do you all think that this is a useful debate about ethics and evidence, or am I just seeding students with the idea of not respecting clients' subjective experience?**\n\n\\[Note: *I'm not looking for your opinions on whether or not DID exists*.  I'm just looking for perspectives about whether it'd be ethical to debate this in class or not.  Thanks!\\]",

I'm wondering if the social science community has settled on how to define what/who is and isn't neurodivergent. Does _neurodiverge*_ have definitive clinical or scientific meaning? Is it semantically challenged?\n\nI'm asking this very seriously and am interested in answers more than opinions. Opinions great for perspective. But I want to know what researchers believe to be scientifically valid.\n\nMy current understanding (with questions) is:\n\n1. When most people discuss neurodivergence, they are probably talking about autism, ADHD, dyslexia, synesthesia, dysgraphia, and perhaps alexithymia. These conditions are strongly heritable and believed to originate in the developing brain. These relate strongly to cognition and academic and professional attainment. Is this what makes them special? Is that a complete set?\n\n2. Almost all psychological conditions, diseases, disorders, and syndromes have some neurological basis almost all the time. How someone is affected by their mom dying is a combination of neurological development, social/emotional development, and circumstance, right?\n\n3. It's unclear which aspects of the neurodiverse conditions listed in 1. are problematic intrinsically or contextually. If an autistic person with low support needs only needs to communicate with other autistic people, and they don't mind them rocking and waving their hands, then do they have a condition? If an autistic person wants to be able to talk using words but finds it extremely difficult and severely limiting that they can't, are they just neuro-different?\n\nThanks!\n\n^1 Diagnosed AuDHD in 2021/2022.

I said I did the study because this was a methodological innovation that allowed us to find quantitative evidence in support of the theory for the first time.\n\n  \nI know this is no big deal, and I thought it didn't bother me at the time, but it is really eating me up. It was humiliating and it made me feel bad for having given the talk. I cried myself to sleep the night of the talk and I even considered withdrawing my paper (the one I presented) which has been accepted for publication.\n\nObviously, I am calmer now, I did not withdraw my paper, and I know this is just how it goes. But it still really hurts. I am looking for some advice/perspectives/stories/etc.",

      "body": "Hey all,\n\n*For context of where I'm at mentally right now; it's 4.25am UK time and I've been awake since 8am the morning previously. :)  I'm in such a state of panic right now jesus christ.*\n\n**To cut to the chase**: I'm finishing my Psychology Masters' dissertation. We all were required to write our Ethics Form firstly, a year ago, before any other construction of our actual thesis/methodologies/designs/data collection etc really began. We had to create the ethics form, submit it to be officially approved etc etc. So mine was approved Summer last year.  \n**Fast forward to now.** I've since long forgotten about it, been busy finishing up the rest of my quant. thesis. I literally have 3 days left until the deadline lol.\n\n***THE ISSUE***\\*\\*:\\*\\* moments ago, I just happened to check my original ethics form for some reason. And I happened to notice what could be a *MASSIVE PROBLEM AND I'M FREAKING OUT*. My original ethics form now - fully approved, fully submitted, states that I would be using 2 independent variables (for some context, IV1: success. IV2 relationships)\n\nAnd how is my almost-fully-completed, almost-ready-to-submit Dissertation looking now? I've now got ENTIRELY different variables. THREE variables now. (of course my overall thesis subject matter aims and objectives are exactly the same as the ethics form, but these details such as variables have now totally changed. AND even just my original title alone in the ethics form, now doesn't exactly reflect what my current research title would/should be now.)\n\nAnd I don't know if it's resulting anxiety from severe lack of sleep (3am here in the uk), or if this could genuinely be a HUGE, HUGE issue for me. I am terrified. Right now. Terrified. That because my now current, fully formed study (days away from completion) has an entirely different variables set than what I stated on my (now approved) ethics form...could this mean huge trouble for me? Grading-wise?\n\nWould the markers see all of my work (thesis PLUS the ethics form too) and instantly see the GLARING discrepancy / inconsistency about a very vital piece of a quant. report and fail me entirely?\n\nBut then surely - if this could be the case - why would they expect students to make a solid, written-in-stone decision on the design of their thesis so, so early in the game? So maybe, they take that in consideration, and an ethics form (once approved) is only required from students to literally, simply prove the student's ability to meet ethical criterion? And the rest is a moot point, sort of, because they understand the finer details are a work in progress..?\n\nI've already emailed the module leader (of course will likely now not sleep at all until she replies hopefully by some merciful way by tomorrow....) Anyway. Thank you all. I don't think I have ever been more dazed, stressed, and terrified before.",

I have coded a handful individually (separate folders) within NVIVO and found recurring patterns and themes. I was going to merge the codes of each one into slightly broader initial coding; however, i have skipped a step and made themes and 'sub-themes' in which i am merging the initial codes into. My themes and sub themes are niche enough where there is little overlap. \n\nHowever, i am a little confused about whether I should proceed in this way or not.\n\n Is NVIVO essentially a means for me to organise my data for when I need to retrieve quotes for my write-up? Should I be merging the initial codes together and keeping them below the subthemes or can i continue to just use the subthemes.   \n  \nI am not sure if i will need to display how i have organised my codes in my write-up up and if by being more specific will be better for it, or is it just a way for me to find quotes easier?\n\nHopefully, that makes sense.\n\nThanks",

Was it based on the scientific evidence and methodologies available at the time, or was it more a reflection of cultural, moral, or political influences?\n\nAlso, how did the process of declassifying homosexuality as a disorder unfold?

I'm a 22-year-old psychology student and this little topic has become fascinating to me. \n\nRecently, I came across a very interesting study named [“Depression Is who I am”: Mental illness identity, stigma,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402345)[ and wellbeing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402345), for which one result was that *'social identification as depressed magnified, rather than buffered, the relationship between stigma and reduced wellbeing'*. \n\nThis led me down a rabbit hole and made me question the 'mentally well vs mentally ill' dichotomy a diagnosis seems to create.\n\nMuch has been said about the dangers of 'othering' the mentally ill and there's been very lengthy debates on the topic of stigmatization. However, I haven't found much discussion on what happens when the roles are reversed.\n\nAs someone who has battled with depression, among some other mental illnesses, I've been pondering about the damage it may cause to see those who are mentally well as an outgroup to pin ourselves against. This has become relevant especially now that I've been doing much better with recovery, since it has made giving up my 'depressed' identity, leaving one group for the other, so much harder. \n\nThe harms of creating a dichotomy between those who have been diagnosed with a mental illness and those who haven't are clear, mostly when the prevalence of mental disorders and their nature is still such a contentious subject of study.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this topic? What are the possible damages of acquiring this sort of mindset? What leads people to engage in that mentality in the first place? \n\nI'd love to hear other insights and outlooks!",

Commonly from childhood, where prolonged neglect or abuse was experienced.\n\nSo it is a response that makes you conflict-avoidant and this results in behaviour such as trying not to cause conflict by making people happy or satisfied.\n\nBut the main thing is that it's 100% a **trauma response**, and this is completely separate from being on the more considerate, kind, or friendly side of personality or agreeable.\n\nAm I understanding the concept correctly?",

      "title": "Using DSM diagnoses as the basis of research studies on disorders is a fundamentally flawed concept that is inconsistent with the concept of construct validity",
      "body": "I understand that it is difficult to make something like the DSM. I think the latest DSM is reasonable for its purpose: to diagnose in the clinical context.\n\nHowever, I think it is problematic to use DSM diagnoses as the basis of research in terms of clinical disorders. This is because the DSM is a superficial list of criteria, which can lead to incorrect or unnecessary dual diagnosis. This is not a flaw of the DSM itself: it is the flaw of the clinician. The DSM is categorical and vague on purpose. It is the task of the clinician to use clinical judgement to diagnose. Said another way, generally speaking, DSM has a lot of criteria for each disorder, so it is \"permissive\" as opposed \"mandatory\" in this regard. But it is up to the clinician to ensure that the correct diagnosis is made, such as ensuring that the root reasons for each criteria are consistent with the construct of the actual disorder (and not just the DSM-defined disorder, with its long list of possible superficial criteria), as opposed to blanket diagnosing just because the permissible number of superficial criteria for a given disorder were met.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not enough emphasis on this: too many clinicians blanket diagnose every possible disorder as long as enough superficial criteria are met. Then, research is based of this initial mistake. That is why for example, there are some studies that show the comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD are as high as 45%. This is a farce, because if one actually knows about the \"construct\" (and not the DSM-disorder) of \"OCD\" and \"ADHD\", they would know that they can manifest in similar symptoms superficially, but the root reason for the symptoms being elicited is completely different. For example, someone with ADHD can obsess, but it would be due to having low dopamine, and a stimulant may for example fix their obsession. They may superficially meet the OCD DSM-diagnosis, which is permissive, but what is the utility/validity of giving this OCD diagnosis on top of the ADHD, which is the root cause of the symptoms? If you give ADHD and treat with stimulants, that would be sufficient. Why give OCD, it would complicate the clinical picture, and if you give just give SSRIs without stimulants it would either make things worse or have a weak or no effect. Similarly, someone with OCD also meets ADHD criteria but it is due to their OCD, but the construct of OCD is the root of their issues, if you give them stimulants due to the ADHD disorder you will make them worse.\n\nDSM diagnoses are there to legitimize diagnosis in the clinical context. But by using DSM diagnoses as the basis for research and as the basis for the construct validity of disorders, bias is unnecessarily being introduced into the process and distorting the accuracy of the studies. It is a logical error: you can't diagnose with DSM then double down and do studies based on this diagnosis and then claim that it shows construct validity for a disorder. Construct validity is not based on correlations (these can be wrong, as shown above), it is based on causation. Here is a useful paper in this regard:\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8234397\\_The\\_Concept\\_of\\_Validity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8234397_The_Concept_of_Validity)\n\nEssentially, what is happening is that when DSM diagnoses are used for research, this has the possibility of producing correlations that are not based on causality.\n\nThis is also relevant:\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339536314\\_The\\_Heterogeneity\\_of\\_Mental\\_Health\\_Assessment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339536314_The_Heterogeneity_of_Mental_Health_Assessment)",

It's based on Costa and McCrae's FFM, using an ipsative approach. The initial factor analyses on a sample of \\~400 shows a five factor structure with items ranging anywhere from the low .3s to high .7s. Based on the fact that there is a very limited amount of research in this space, I believe that this is very encouraging.\n\nWe added captions as it was requested by users after the first trial beta. The initial research was done on images only without any captions and showed ~~exceptionally~~ promising results.

      "body": "# Background\n\nHere I examine the evidence for the popular hypothesis that ADHD is not a disorder but rather a mismatch between contemporary culture and traits that were adaptive in some way during earlier stages of human evolution.\n\nThe adaptationist or mismatch hypothesis posits that cultural evolution outpaced biological evolution, leading to traits that were once advantageous for human survival in earlier evolutionary periods becoming maladaptive due to societal shifts. For example, Hartmann and others proposed that ADHD is a representation of successful hunters in the hunter-gatherer phase of evolution now forced to live among farmers in contemporary society.\n\n# The evidence\n\nSome have proposed that ADHD represents a distinct binary \"type\" of human (hunter = ADHD vs. farmer = non-ADHD) continuously being inherited due to the current imbalance of society and evolution. This contradicts research findings:\n\n* ADHD is rarely caused by a single genetic abnormality; it is polygenic meaning that in most cases, many genetic risk variants, each exerting a very small effect, accumulate to cause the disorder ([Demontis et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0269-7); [Faraone et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#sec0035)).\n* ADHD represents the extreme lower end of the [continuous dimensional trait](https://imgbb.com/r0XLwjS) of executive functioning and self-regulation, which is supported by twin, brain imaging and molecular genetic studies ([Larsson, Anckarsater et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21923806/); [Lee, Ripke et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23933821/); [Hoogman et al., 2019](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18091033); [Barkley, Antshel et al., 2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8106-5_7); [Hart et al., 2013](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1485446) (replicated: [Lukito et al., 2020](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/comparative-metaanalyses-of-brain-structural-and-functional-abnormalities-during-cognitive-control-in-attentiondeficithyperactivity-disorder-and-autism-spectrum-disorder/ED38EB66D818A8D1A531C62D8097572B) & [Norman et al., 2016](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2526239)); [Faraone et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#sec0065)).\n* A subset of ADHD cases are non-genetic but acquired due to exposure to biological hazards ([Faraone et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#sec0035)) or injurious events to the brain ([Eme, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/ern.12.15); [Asarnow et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34251435/); [Stojanovski et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632231831669X); [Adeyemo et al., 2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054714543371)).\n* A small subset of ADHD genetic cases are not inherited but arise de-novo due to a major genetic mutation ([Faraone & Larsson, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380%E2%80%90018%E2%80%900070%E2%80%900)).\n\n[Culcalla et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65322-4) study in Nature: Scientific Reports compared the ADHD gene variants in samples of humans in modern, ancient and archaic populations going back to Neanderthals. They found substantial evidence that natural selection has been acting against these genetic variants throughout human evolution.\n\nHigher risk for injury, mortality and morbidity, multiple medical disorders, health risks and shortened life expectancy, etc. associated with ADHD ([Faraone et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#sec0065)) are hard to reconcile with cultural mismatch hypothesis.\n\nAn alternative and more scientifically-established theory argues that ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders are implicated with a set of maladaptive traits that can remain at a stable rate within a human population. New mutations arise all the time in the genes for ADHD (and other neurodevelopmental disorders) in each new generation and that it takes multiple generations for natural selection to remove those original mutations. Despite their being removed, new mutations continue to arise in the next generation that go on to create disorder. If the new mutation rate and the genetic removal (death) rates (natural selection) reach a certain level of balance with each other, the result is a stable rate of a maladaptive trait (disorder) within a population (say, 5-8%). The available evidence is more consistent with this theory than with the hypothesis of cultural mismatch ([Keller, 2008](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-18235-008)).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nData suggests that ADHD was not an adaptative trait in ancient times. The disorder may be maintained by the balance of genetic mutations and removal rate (natural selection) across generations; over thousands of years, these genetic variants become more stable, decreasing disorder prevalence. Further research should investigate the implications of these results.",

      "body": "I don't know if this type of post is allowed, but an earlier post on whether someone could call themselves a psychologist brought to mind something that really irked me a while back. A couple of years ago a friend shared with me [this article from Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/your-neurochemical-self/201910/personal-responsibility-and-mental-health#:~:text=Personal%20responsibility%20is%20the%20spark%20that%20allows%20%E2%80%9Chelp%E2%80%9D%20to%20help.&text=It's%20time%20that%20we%20fix,the%20skills%20are%20actually%20learned). The article irked me so much that I went looking for Dr. Breuning's bio and discovered that while she indeed has a doctorate, it is not related to psychology or neuroscience or anything related to mental health (and neither has she done any academic work in the field of psych., neuroscience, etc.). It seems the comments to the article were deleted, but what bothered me about what I would personally consider a misrepresentation of credentials, is that some people had made comments agreeing with her and being very dismissive of mental illness (reflective of the stigma and judgment cast upon those who are suffering from MH conditions). There were some depression sufferers that were very hurt by some of the statements made by Breuning but shared their experienced. While I know Psychology Today is just a pop psychology magazine, I was disappointed that they didn't clarify what her qualifications were so that people wouldn't equate her title with expertise in the field of psychology when reading her opinions.",

We invited 159 participants to come to the lab to undergo the Trier Social Stress Test-a paradigm designed to induce moderate amounts of social-evaluative stress that asks participants to give a speech in front of two passive committee members and a fake video camera and to work on a hard mathematical task. One third self-touched (i.e. placed their right hand on their heart and their left hand on their belly), one third was hugged by a female research assistant, and one third build a paper plane (the control condition). We also asked if the effectiveness of the touch interventions would depend on whether our participants identified more strongly with the person providing the hug. We measured heart rate, subjective-emotional responses to stress, and cortisol. We found that cortisol levels in the self-touch and hug conditions were lower on three out of four measurement points after the stressor. Subjective-emotional responses and heart rate were unaffected by the touch interventions and social identification had no influence on the results.\n\nThe paper was published in an open access journal and is free to read for everyone: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666497621000655](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666497621000655)",

      "body": "You can read my long account.  But the title is what I am asking.   How can I warn others without it coming back on me.  I'm still in program.  I dont want retaliation.\n\n-----\n\n\nSo im a 3rd year grad student and a top tiered private university.  \n\nThere are two main supervisors for the lab I'm in.  The first, Professor A is just a horrible toxic person.  This professor was my original mentor when I started. I could give an account of unprofessional behaviors that started literally on my first day.  But I'll just say the main problems with their behavior. \n\nThey have told me repeatedly (including my very first lab meeting with the other students) that I didn't have what it takes to do a PhD.  Said some people just weren't intelligent enough and I was one of those people.  \nBerated me like this for a good 15 min rant. I have no idea why as I had barely spoken to this professor at that point.   I went home and cried after my first lab meeting.  I was so confused and I've never been so humiliated. Even worse it was in front of my peers whom I was trying to start a working-friendships with.  \n\nNo idea why Prof A offered me a position when they so obviously thought so little of me.  (Although I have some suspicion that they are required to have grad students per their contract and I'm the only one who accepted). \n\nThen they refused to approve my research project.  The project I had presented to them months prior to starting and had devoted a considerable amount of time in the months before starting, to developing.\n\nThen in the proceeding weekly lab meetings, they continued to make comments about how I was behind. Wasn't doing anything. Didn't even have a project idea. I should just quit now instead of wasting his time. \n\n\nWhich was incredibly frustrating.  Because I had worked on one.  But they had threw it out.  \n\nDuring these weeks they never met with me in private.  They preferred to berate me in front of others.  Honestly I was not wanting to meet them privately after the first lab meeting. Assuming it would be worse than the public belittling. \n\nSo to try to appease this person I tried to create a new project with the other professor.  Professor B.  Same lab.  This person helped me come up with a new plan.  This professor is sort of fantastic.  Really the opposite of the tyrant. \n\nWe worked for many weeks on polishing a new project. I made a PowerPoint to present my project. \n\nThis time I received almost a full 30 min rant about how incompetent I was. How I wasn't a real scientist.  Lots of personal comments about my character. He said i was pretending I knew about topics that I didn't.  That I was a fake.\n\nThe thing is he had no idea what sort of knowledge I had about the topics because he never talked to me. \n\nProf B even tried to stop him from this rant.   Which btw , was an online zoom presentation. \n\nHe dismissed her and continued on.  \n\nThen at the end I turned off my video. \nAnd then he continued talking to the others saying how I needed to hear these hard truths. I wasn't qualified. Yada Yada. \nI actually have a masters already.  I'm not new to the field.  My associates and undergrad were both psych.  My masters was in neuro.\n\nI'm still a student. But I've put in a lot of work and I think I deserve a little more respect than that.  Honestly no one deserves to be spoken to like that.  \n\n\nSo this all went down like 6 months in.  So after the meeting I decided I needed to switch supervisors. I was able to switch to Prof B even though this professor now had 4 grad students (including me). Which is a lot to handle.  But even so she makes time for me and has helped me come up with projects. \n\nProf B suggested I start attending a different lab's meeting.  Maybe work on a project for that lab.  But my heart just wasn't in it.  I really love the topic of the lab I joined.  I barely could follow most of this other lab's research as I knew very little about it at the start. I didn't really know anyone in the lab either. \n\nSo not only had Prof A repeatedly tried to humiliat me in front of my lab mates. Then I was no longer comfortable attending lab meetings.  Add covid on top of that and I'm completely isolated from other students. I don't know the people in this other lab and it's sort of impossible to build friendships during structured zoom meetings.\n\nI no longer had any interaction with any of the other grads in my lab.  This went on for a little over a year. It was a rough year. \n\nThen I brought this up with Prof B. \n\nThis person also seemed to be getting irritated from Prof A.  Also.  Prof A only had one grad student who has graduated at this point.   So they don't even have any grad students at present and maybe they don't even need to come to meetings.  All they do is go on these long rants anyway. \n\n\nSo then Prof B set up weekly lab meetings I go to with my lab mates. And then they have a special meeting every few weeks with Prof A and not me.  \n\n\nThis has mostly worked out great.  I've managed to build my relationships with my lab mates.  Honestly it's a great place and people when Prof A isn't around.  \nProbably because of Prof B. \n\nI've had great experiences with the other professors I've TA-ed for.  Everyone else there has been so supportive and helpful.  Which has really helped me ignore Prof A. \n\nRecently I decided to reach out to Prof A to ask for help on a calculation I was trying to do. I couldn't find a formula for something and figured he would know. And I thought maybe after all this time he has chilled out and maybe working on this together would put water under the bridge. \n\n\nI emailed about the calculation. \nHe asked why I needed the formula. \nI explained why.  He sent a very long email back saying I was stupid, my project was stupid, and I should drop out.  \nI'm not exaggerating. \nHonestly at this point I'm just rolling my eyes.  Like.  Dude crazy.  I just asked for a formula I couldn't find online.  \n\nI didn't reply. \n\nThen. Next day I check email.  Another email.  Super long. \nHe CCed Prof B on it.  \nTold me how I wasn't a real scientist and I didn't even read it all. I just saw that he explained how he knew for certain I was an idiot.  Again.  Never actually spoke to me about what I do or don't know about the topic. \n\nSeemed to not understand why I wanted the formula. Made some assumptions about my character based on this request. \n\nAt the end, told me to drop out.  \nThe subject was \"keep an open mind\".\n\nHow delusional is this person?\n\n\n\nOkay.  So I just avoid the guy.  Not too hard. \nWhatever. He is annoying more than anything at this point.   I found someone else to help with the formula. \nI'm sure copies of the emails and such that I have will be sufficient to keep him off any committee or decision making panel.   \n\n\nBut recently another lab mate told me he is now receiving similar bullying from Prof A.  \nAnd unlike me, this person is younger and much more sensitive to this belittling.  \n\nI've also seen Prof A belittle another student. \n\nHonestly as a woman I am aware when abuse is directed due to me being a female. I dont think that is what is happening because the other two bullied students are male.  But there is something we do all have in common. \n\nWe are all disadvantaged and are first Gen students. \n\nBoth of the other 2 males are both from minority groups.  None of us three come in with fancy prep school educations or affluent families.  We are less confident about where we are. \n\nHe picks on those he knows he can get away with it. \n\nNone of us 3 are going to feel like we can make formal complaints.  We are grateful to be there. He knows it.  \n\nEven I've been okay with his behavior since I've been able to avoid him. \nI never asked for an apology or his behavior to be addresses by higher ups.  I never filed any complaints. \n\n\nBut lately I'm realizing it's not okay.  The one guy has really been hurt by these comments. Told me he wasn't even sure if his research is worth anything and thinking of giving up.  This, after Prof A told him he wasn't doing real science at last lab meeting. \n\n\nLike it is just so shitty to be like that. I don't get why someone feels it necessary to constantly put others down.  \n\nSo. To get more to the point. Prof B, is retiring in a few years. As soon as all of their grad students get finished.\n\nSo just Prof A left. \nI know they tried to recruit a student this last round but I don't think it worked out.  I didn't get to meet the recruit. \n\nHonestly I want to make sure no one agrees to work with him. I am an older student and it took me 11 years to get my undergrad and masters (I had a full time job so I could eat)  I made a lot of sacrifices to get into grad school. Just to have someone almost ruin it for me. \nAnd they have created a lot of obstacles for me I'm still trying to make up for.  \n\nThough it's irrelevant how long it took me.  It's a lot of work for anyone.  No one deserves to be treated like that. \n\nI think his contract requires him to have at least one grad student or teach more hours. So he just wants someone to join. Then get them to drop. So he has to do less work.  That's what I think. \n\nSo ruin someone's life for his own ends. \n\nI was told he hasn't had a grad student stick around longer than 1 year for many many except the one who graduated right after I arrived.  According to Prof B.  That is the only graduating student he has ever had. \n\nI think that student just stuck it out and kept her head down.  She warned me he wasn't easy to work with and that he doesn't socialize or go to conferences (after I arrived).  So no networking through him.  I mistakenly thought that would be the biggest challenge. \n\n\nI dont want to very publicly announce this person to be what they are because I'm going to finish this program and this person happens to be chair. \n\nSo it would not go well for me. \n\nAt the same time I can't sit back and continue to be complacent in letting him screw over other students who are vulnerable.  \n\nI'm very upset about him bullying this other student whom has confided in me a lot of anxieties already.  Being first Gen. Coming from disadvantaged background.  \n\nI suggested this other student do what I do.  And not have lab meetings with him. But its just ridiculous that two lab meetings have to be done in the first place to keep him from bullying students.\n\nAlso if someone wants this last email he sent I will share it with you.   But im not posting it publicly.\n\nYou will see just how bad it really is.",

      "body": "Hello fellow psychs! Christmas is rapidly approaching, and I have decided to write a total troll paper called “A psychometric approach to reducing Santa’s carbon footprint” to the great confusion of everyone at my faculty! I know that the concept of a scientific equivalent to your average shitpost is not novel and economists have in fact a [virtual specialized issue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14657295/homepage/virtual_specialized_issue_on_economic_humor.htm) of the Economic Inquiry dedicated to such papers. It includes gems such as:\n\n“[A first lesson in econometrics](https://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/classes/eco7377/papers/siegfried.pdf)”, where the author turn 1+1=2 into an absolute monstrosity, as well as “[Macroeconomic Policy and the Optimal Destruction of Vampires](https://www.doi.org/10.1086/261080)” which is exactly what the title suggests.\n\nI was wondering whether we too have a collection of papers like this in our field. So far, I have found this [brilliant paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00052.x) in which the author lays the groundwork for the interstellar domination of the IAT.

Instead of encouraging men to embrace their masculine traits and to grow into their masculinity responsibly, they are treating these traits as symptoms which need to be cured. The guidelines appear to be based on the controverisal ideological stance (arising in more recent waves of feminism) of the \"blank state\" - the idea that any psychological differences between men and women are the result of culture rather than nature. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

      "body": "Hey people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nI am a designer who recently graduated from a Postgraduate Degree in Psychology. I always believed designers often speculate about user experience, often end up designing a product that is more suitable for them than the users. I have started working with the product design studio which is rigours in their approach to mechanical system and material science, specifically because I would like to improve my skill in these areas. However, I often end up being belittled for my degree in psychology, and my knowledge about research on user experience. It makes me believe they think that their speculation is as good as any literature review I might have done. I have come to realise that they believe that \"soft\" science isn't as rigorous as \"hard\" science and that the study of subjective experience is wasteful.\n\n**Literature Review**\n\nSceptics argue that Psychology isn't science because it lacks clearly defined terminology, quantifiability, highly controlled experimental conditions, reproducibility and, predictability and testability (Berezow, 2012). Jogalekar (2013) countered the argument by claiming that consistent and semi-quantifiable definitions that are useful enough to make testable predictions are necessary, not defined terminology and quantifiability. He points out that statistics compensates for the lack of highly controlled experimental conditions and testability, which is commonly used by the branch of physics such as particle physics. He further argues that in science, understanding is equally or more important than prediction.\n\nJogalekar (2013) points out we know very little about biology and social systems to achieve the kind of quantitative prediction that sciences like physics do. This line of thinking raises the question if a psychologist should be up to date about the research in the field such as neuroscience.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. What are the specific arguments you have come across? Especially arguments that claim:    \n\\- Psychology isn't real science  \n\\- Psychology isn't useful\n2. Is there a counter-argument?\n3. Are there any valid criticisms? If so, what can we do about it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References**\n\nBerezow, A.B. (2012, July 12).

      "body": "So given the zeitgeist of scientific psychology today, i.e. crisis of confidence, replication crisis, open science, whatever you want to call it, there are a few approproate responses of the average researcher:\n\n1. Paralysis in face of the overwhelming amount of issues\n\n2. Carry on undisturbed\n\n3. Become more curious as to how *exactly* our science works (or doesn't)\n\nI honestly don't know which is the most constructive or most wise, but assuming you're leaning towards 3 (after strongly considering 1 and 2), I've got just the thing. Enter Paul Meehl.\n\n\nMeehl was a clinical psychologist and professor at U of Minnessota, and he was big on, amongst other things, schizophrenia research, construct validity, and philosphy of science. His written work and recordings of the Philosophical Psychology course are available [here](http://meehl.umn.edu/).\n\n\nI would highly recommend reading whatever you find interesting (I might list some 'classics' that I was recommended) but also the lecture recordings: Meehl covers philosophy of science historically in the first 2-3 lectures and his insight may be invaluable because he actually got to talk to and work with some of the key people in phil of science and psychology. His name-dropping is wonderflly anecdotal and illuminating. Later he extends on the Popperian notion of falsification (which I think most undergrad method courses fall short of) and extends it in an original way. He does not restrict himself to armchair observations of science, but goes straight into pertinent issues that come up in practice (research and clinical work). I'm only halfway so can't speak for the whole thing, but I am very much hooked.\n\n\nI can safely assume most undergrad methods courses are fairly isomorphic and don't deviate much from the under-explicated notion of Popper and implicitly confalting hypotheses and theories, and that does leave one wanting. Being aware of the cogs and gears of testing theories and hypotheses makes you more appreciative thinking scientifically. And, to paraphrase Meehl, it's fun.\n\nAdditionally, if you are a psychometrician (i.e. working with questionnaires and psychometric tests), some papers found in the link above will be directly relevant to the notion of what we study with these methods. It may be a little advanced for the undergrad level, but I'm sure everyone would be a little wiser after reading his stuff.\n\nMore very useful and interesting resources and researchers are very much present online, I'd be happy to share websites of those that I'm aware of.",

      "title": "Interested in working in Mental Health? MSW MFT MCP PhD PsyD This Post is All About Accreditation!!!",
      "body": "Hey everyone, wanted to do a post here about choosing grad schools for licensure very carefully. If you are thinking about going for a PhD or masters in the mental health field please give this a read! A lot of my examples describe California specific situations, but this is true of other states, look up info in your respective state.\n\nMany people seem to sign up for PhD and masters programs without doing enough research into them, and it costs them a fortune and wastes their time because they can't practice with the degree they got. For example, I know someone who got a masters in clinical psychology who thought that could lead to a career in therapy. There are also many online programs that offer degrees like this which are not actually accredited programs. Don't just jump into a grad program, be careful, do your research!\n\nAnother common mistake is thinking a masters degree one earns while working on a PhD could lead to licensure, this is also often wrong. For example, I'm in an MSW program at UCLA, we have a PhD in social work as well. The PhD is a totally different curriculum than the MSW, and it's not accredited. So if I got a \"masters\" as part of that PhD it would not be something I could get a license with because it's not CSWE accredited and it's not the same as an \"MSW.\" In fact, the MSW is actually called a \"professional degree\" it's not a \"masters\" in reality, it just uses the term \"master of\" in the title, similar to how a law degree is known as a \"Juris Doctor\" JD - they aren't doctors, it's a 3 year professional degree. \n\nSo don't make the mistake of thinking there are 2 birds with one stone deals, or loopholes, where you get a PhD in something and pick up your masters along the way and get a masters level clinical license, do your research. Another mistake is getting into a masters degree program like masters of clinical psychology and thinking, I'll just do this now and it will save me time later when I \"finish\" the PhD in clinical psychology at some other school or another time. This isn't like transferring from community college, many classes may not count, and you join into a cohort usually, it's not often the case that you get a masters and then merge into a PhD program for the last few years of the PhD, that's not how it works. You either go for the PhD in full or you go for the masters in full.\n\nIf you want to be a \"therapist,\" you need a license to practice therapy or any other interventions with people, you will need to first go on the state's website for licensure. In California that is the BBS board of behavioral sciences website for masters level degrees like the MFT master of marriage and family therapy, MCP master of counseling psychology, and MSW master of social work and a few others. The MFT leads to the LMFT license, the MCP leads to the LPCC license, and the MSW leads to the LCSW license.\n\nWhen you go on the BBS website or the licensing board of whatever state you are interested in working in, they explain what the educational requirements are and part of that is that the university you earn the degree from must be \"regionally accredited\" in UCI's case and most universities in the Western U.S. that's WASC, or Western Association of Schools and Colleges https://www.acswasc.org/. Furthermore, the program \"masters program or doctoral program\" itself must be accredited by an \"accrediting organization.\"\n\nFor MFT programs that's COAMFTE https://www.coamfte.org/ for MCP programs thats CACREP https://www.cacrep.org/ and for MSW programs thats CSWE https://www.cswe.org/.\n\nFor those interested in a PhD or PsyD or who wish to become \"licensed psychologists\" California and other states have licensing boards for this as well. In California that would be the California Board of Psychology https://www.psychology.ca.gov/. They explain the requirements in this state. Like the masters degrees, the title of the doctorate is important. They say the degree name must fall under this description which you can access here https://www.psychology.ca.gov/applicants/license.shtml \"Section 2914 of the Business and Professions Code (Code) provides that individuals who possess an earned doctorate degree in psychology, educational psychology, education with a field of specialization in counseling psychology or education with a field of specialization in educational psychology from an approved or accredited educational institution meet the educational requirements for licensure.\"\n\nHere is what the California Board of Psychology says about accreditation https://www.psychology.ca.gov/applicants/schools.shtml \"Applicants for licensure that apply after on or January 1, 2020, must possess an earned doctorate degree in psychology, educational psychology, or education with the field of specialization in counseling psychology or educational psychology from a college or institution of higher education that is accredited by a regional accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education.\"\n\nDoctoral programs that lead to licensure in the U.S. are generally PhD in psychology or clinical psychology or a PsyD degree, and it must be from a regionally accredited university and an \"APA\" accredited university program.https://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/programs/\n\nSome states may not require an accreditation organization like COAMFTE, APA, or CACREP to accredit the specific program for licensure in that state, but many states do require this. If you choose an unaccredited program and choose to later move out of state, you run the risk of not being able to get licensed wherever you move to if that state's licensing board does not recognize unaccredited programs. A state may review syllabuses and determine if the program meets their requirements but this can be a time consuming process and there is no assurance it will work out. So your safest bet is an accredited program\n\nBeware of online programs, many are not properly accredited here is an article about that https://www.geteducated.com/…/534-apa-accredited-online-psy…. Any programs you research, always look into their accreditation status, make sure they are regionally accredited and that the program itself is approved for licensure in your state AND that it is accredited by the accrediting organization for the profession that degree is associated with.",

And this research will find some right things in these theories explanations \n\nI try to read Handbooks and there's a lot of chapters about psychoanalysis and they treat it like a science. And like every other theory. You ask some student at 1st world country and he will say Freud's theory isn't something they take at college\n\nI can't find what's scientific and what is not. Everything is criticized and everything seems not valid. But at the scientific research every theory is gonna be discussed seriously.

At bear minimum, expand on the meaning of \"Rule 4: Low Effort Content and Academic Tone.\" Creating a post with AI is about as low-effort as you could possibly do. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has no issue with AI when used as a learning and efficiency tool.\n\nThe issue here has nothing to do with formatting and everything to do with the degree of effort invested in articulating \"original\" ideas.\n\nThe half-baked material people present with these \"AI Theories\" (which are far from even a well-thought-out notion) read like pure nonsense! I don't care if you like how your ideas sound. What undermines credibility is outsourcing the *entirety* of the intellectual labor to AI. Read an actual paper!\n\nAt the very least (!!!), demonstrate that you care enough about your own ideas to actually express them yourself. If you could not have arrived at this “grand framework” without AI’s assistance, then perhaps the idea is not yours to claim. And if it truly is your work, then you should be able to present it independently, *without* relying on an automated system to do so.\n\n**This is not what it means to use AI as a tool.**\n\nHow can you say \"I used AI as a tool\" when \"the tool\" in question (AI) is *creating* your thoughts (or at least feeding them back to you in such a manner that you snowball into some grand \"epiphany loop\")?\n\nI have no issues with AI as a tool. THIS is not what a tool does.\n\nEven *if* the nonsense you're spewing is true ... if what you're saying is so monumental ... then articulate it in **your own words** in such a way that we feel it is deserving of our time to read!\n\n*Look at it like this:*\n\nIf you bought a bunch of fancy ingredients (Wagyu steak, caviar, truffles, etc.) and told me you were going to make me a Michelin-star meal ... but then you blended it up and poured it into a cardboard cup and served it to me ... Of course I'm going to focus on the means and not the meaning! I don't care what's *in* the fishy meat smoothie; I wanted my Michelin-star meal!\n\nThe same applies here. Whether or not you've concocted something actually meaningful doesn't matter. Your message gets lost in the way you presented it, and now none of us care.\n\n**TL;DR - there's about a 99.9% chance you didn't build anything and just fed your half-baked ideas to ChatGPT or Claude and then had it regurgitate them back to you with psychological jargon that I doubt you even understand.

      "body": "A year or so ago now someone created this post: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/164kywu/does_anyone_else_consider_evolutionary_psychology/\n\nFollowing a brief discussion, the user blocked me, and seems to have had their account suspended. \n\n\nConsequently, I cannot seem to reply to any comments on the post. \n\n\nHowever, I am still to this day receiving comments on it, in relation to my comments on the post. Some positive, some negative. Both are welcome (and, though I somewhat suspect that some of the negative ones are from the person whose account is suspended, as many have very little Reddit interaction, and then suddenly interact with this year old post). I appreciate constructive dialogue, and welcome it, so am posting this as an opportunity for those commenting on the above post to comment if they sincerely want to discuss things academically. \n\n\n\nMy position: \n\nEvolutionary Psychology is not a pseudoscience. There's a plethora of empirical backing for Evo Psych that I have already outlined in the above linked post. It can be used as a pseudoscience if reductively generalised to explain away all human cognition, emotion, behaviour, etc. but I have personally never seen an instance of this that's registered as salient to me. Nonsense is nonsense. \n\n\n\nSocial Psychology, and Social *Constructionist/Constructivist principles are somewhat of an antithesis to Evolutionary Psychology. I don't consider this field to be a pseudoscience either, unless, as with Evo Psych, it is reductively generalised to explain away all human cognition, emotion, behaviour, etc.\n\n\nThere're plenty of instances of good and bad takes in both fields - just as there are in competing schools of Psychotherapy, and most all Academic fields (for bad takes re: Evo Psych, people have commented that it is used for discriminatory purposes, but I am yet to see any academic example of this, but welcome examples if you provide them; for bad takes re: Social Constructivist type schools see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair ) \n\n\nIf the only tool you have is a hammer, all you will see is a nail. \n\n\nConsequently, I'd recommend reading widely if you're dogmatically holding that any school or figure of Academia, Science, Philosophy, Religion, Literature, etc. has all of the answers. \n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, they're welcome here, but Reddit isn't my life, so forgive any delays in replies.\n\n\n\n*EDIT: \n\nIn response to those incredulous at being asked to cite their claims on an Academic Psychology Sub-reddit: I am simply attempting to encourage people to use the abundant information available to them, in the information age. People used to have walk, drive or cycle to a library to get the kind of information we can access from our homes. Stop being lazy. Don't parrot things you've just heard about without checking them. Don't be surprised when people, reasonably, ask you to provide evidence for what you're saying. Ideally, provide that evidence unprompted. Be open to changing your mind on being corrected. And, hold each other to a higher standard. Wilful ignorance is not acceptable in the modern age.\n\n\n*EDIT 2: \n\"The charge that evolutionary theories and hypotheses are unfalsifiable is unwarranted and has its roots in a commonly accepted, but mistaken, Popperian view of how science operates. Modern evolutionary theory meets the Lakatosian criterion of \"progressivity,\" based on its ability to digest apparent anomalies and generate novel predictions and explanations. Evolutionary psychology has the hallmarks of a currently progressive research program capable of providing us with new knowledge of how the mind works.\" https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327965PLI1101_01",

      "body": "It seems rather short to me especially because patients usually(hopefully) need to get some grounding at the end of the session. If we assume 10  min introduction/getting started; 10 min of grounding in the end (which  might be too little); then we are left with 30 min of therapy left. I can't imagine many topics can be explored with any serious depth in only 30 min or less. It must also be frustrating for therapists because they also are limited in what they can do in the same time span.\n\nI understand the concern of digging too deep or destabilizing but it can easily be more destabilizing to open up and having to stop soon after because then the patient is simply left vulnerable. Wouldn't it be more effective for a psychologist to take less patients but spend more time on each?\n\nWhat is session length based on?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: thank you for all the replies.\n\nEdit 2:  \n\nI must admit that I at times worry about proper care and I admittedly put too much emphasis on the time factor. Because I ultimately see so many people with unresolved traumas of varying severity or people going to therapy for years never really  improving and sometimes becoming dependent on the weekly visit. Or the people who can't really get proper treatment for varying reasons.\n\nThe sentiment of my OP is ultimately better treatment for all and better working conditions as they go hand in hand in my book. And I just want arbitrary constraints to limit anyone involved.",

      "title": "Dissociative Identity Disorder general consesus?",
      "body": "Hi guys, \n\nI'm a bit curious about DID. I'm currently in a graduate program, not for Psychology specifically but something very adjecent. I got my undergrad degree in Clinical Psych, and I remember specifically talking about DID in both a Neuroscience class and evolutionary biology type class, with a focus on psychology (it was an elective and pretty interesting). During both these classes, my professors both talked about how DID is VERY much widely contested, and there is very little evidence to support it's real. They mentioned there being support for things like disosiaction, not recalling long expierences, out-of-body-like expierences, etc. All being real things that happen and have evidence, but SPECIFICALLY, things like having distinct personalities, sometimes with 5-10+, being different genders, age's, etc. as well as these personalities \"interacting\" with one another have no evidence. On the contrary, one of them instead talked about how DID with these extreme personality types, tended to track with pop-culture trends, and that HUGE waves of DID were way more likely when a new movie about the subject came out.\n\nThis was all about 6-7 years ago, and flash forward to today. I'm now almost done my grad program, and I'll be entering my internship pretty soon. I'm still involved with some of my schools undergraduate clubs and orgs, and because of this interact with some younger people. Prior to probably 2-3 years ago, I hadn't ever met anyone with DID. I've now met, through these clubs, 3 people who claim to have it. When trying to speak to my professors about it, I've noticed it's a VERY touchy subject and not one almost any of them want to get into, most of the time they completely avoid the question, or simply say they \"aren't specialized enough to speak on it\" or something akin to this. The people I've met in real life, claim to have quite a few alters, and one of the individuals even does things like make separate discord accounts for them (something I've literally never heard of before). \n\nDoing my own research, I've not been able to find much to support it either, instead I've found that a very small amount of clinicians tend to diagnose the majority of cases, and that most scientific papers written on the subject are done in a small number of journals, again by a small number of professionals which makes me question it even more. \n\nSo I'm basically making this VERY long-winded post to see if there IS some kind of academic consensus on this? It seems like my undergrad professors insisted some parts of it weren't likely to be real, and my current professors don't know much about it, or don't want to talk about it. I don't want to disrespect anyone or anything, I'm just very curious, and I've noticed more people (younger people mainly) have started to say it's something they have experience with in my personal life, which is also something I have very little expierence with.",

      "body": "It's a long irrelevant story but I'm a college athlete looking to transfer because my school doesn't have my degree (it's my first year at this school... like I said long story), and my biggest priority is academics and getting into a good grad school as my goal is to do research in the field.\n\nSince my gpa at this point is ok (3.2), but not great, I'm hoping that transferring as an athlete will allow me to attend a better institution than I could have gotten into.  In my process of looking for potential schools, many of the suitable fits academically/athletically are Christian schools, and when looking at their psychology programs, many of them say that they incorporate the Christian faith into their education. Harding University describes it like this in their mission:\n\n>Relate and integrate the psychological truths found in the Word of God with the knowledge of modern psychological science in order to render greater service in the home, the church and the community.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience of what this is like? On one hand, this sort of interests me, because I'm someone who's been exploring the Christian faith but wouldn't necessarily call myself a Christian, and exploring Christianity from a psychological angle sounds like something that would be really interesting.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm worried it's going to be some Christian form of psychology or they're going to push pseudoscience, and I also wonder/worry about the credibility the education has with graduate schools. I've read about graduate schools discriminating against these types of schools. Genuine spiritual interest in the Christian faith is a new phenomenon for me, I'm someone who's always been sort of a scientific fundamentalist and was an atheist through my teen years, so I'm not very interested in tainting my academic background with a Christian-infused degree while attempting to pursue a graduate degree and career in science. With that said, many of these schools rank very well academically, so I don't know how to approach it.\n\nI know it must differ school to school, but we're talking about your run of the mill decently regarded Christian college. A few I'm looking at are Biola, Harding, Azusa Pacific, and Point Loma. What's the general perception of Christian educations in psychology in academia?",

      "body": "The American Statistical Association released a [statement](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf) on the use of p-values 5 years ago. There was also a special issue in the American Statistician that was [published](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) in 2019 based off the issues addressed in the ASA statement.\n\nEssentially, psychology (among other fields) is very erroneous in our understanding and use of p-values and we have been told by the experts of statistics how to do things differently, and yet as far as I can tell we have made zero progress toward making changes. \n\nI want to ask why you think that is (aside from the fact big changes take time, I suspect there is more going on than that), and also how we can at the individual level begin to make these changes?\n\nSure, we can follow the advice of statisticians on the use of p-values, but all our potential publishers are going to want something different and won't publish what we should be doing (e.g. not making arbitrary decisions based on if p < .05). I'm a grad student, and I only just now found the ASA statement from an internet search--no one in my program is talking about this and when I've brought it up to professors they think I'm wildly misunderstanding something (read the articles I linked, I'm not). So I don't have faith many peer-reviewers in psychology are familiar with this issue either, or if they are that they want to publish articles following these guidelines because most their readers won't be familiar with these ideas.\n\nI would very much appreciate your thoughts on the topic.",

      "body": "Or a cognitive or developmental psychologist? I HATE that I waited this long to consider this but I've been through a lot in the past 10 years but I've always had a love for this field and I know I have the mental capacity, patience, and understanding to pursue it. I am the psychologist in my life to everyone around me and this is how I look at the world anyway. But I'm finally at the point where I have a decent job (pay could always be better) but the job is not stressful at all, lots of freedom and they provide tuition reimbursement. I'm finally at the point where I've been able to settle down, focus on doing whats right and best for me and not have a job and other outside forces to stress me out which I haven't been in this position as an adult ever in my life.\n\nSchoolwork doesn't bother me. Writing, critical thinking is right up my alley. I type around 80 wpm, etc. Just looking for some honest advice. I know this has been asked before but most of the answers were from people in their 20's or early to mid 30's saying its not too late. But I didn't see anybody basically around 40 respond so I would appreciate any advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Edit. I appreciate all the responses. I guess I should give some background on myself. I've been into computers the majority of my life so I always pursued that. I used to be into programming and the technical side as far as fixing them, building them, troubleshooting, etc. I've done that all my life but I've never had a career in it. The kind of guy who would go to school for it but either never finish, or end up trying a different school (online courses). But I've never LOVED computers. I just had a lot of knowledge about them. I've always been into video games. Not like sit around all day and not do anything with your life type of game but that is my favorite hobby so that's how I first got into computers when I was a teenager was playing games like Quake and Unreal Tournament, etc. Then I became fascinated with computers. I was the type of student in elementary and junior high that ALWAYS got good grades, seemingly effortlessly.\n\nBut as I got into high school, I start caring less and less about education. I went to a public school where half the teachers and students didn't care and I started to think it wasn't really that important. Basically I stopped shooting for the stars and just started doing enough to get by. So I've always had a part of that in me. My grandmother was my support system. My mother was just like any other young mother who was just doing what she had to do to make it and support my brother and I. But I lived with my grandmother the majority of my young life until around 24. She passed away from 2 strokes at that time and I felt like my life was over. She was the main one who always supported me.  So after that, I was just burnt out on computers. I couldn't get a job in the field really, probably my own fault and was always blaming something else for why I never made a career out of it. So I would always fix friends and family's computers at a great discount because that's just how I am. I couldn't bring myself to charge people an arm and a leg to fix something that was relatively easy for me to fix even though I know how much I could've really charged people. So eventually that got old and I got tired of people constantly calling me for that reason especially when I wasn't making any money in the field as a career. So while I'm still really knowledgeable about computers, I don't have a love for them anymore and I've been very sure about that for a while now.\n\nNow for the past few years, I've always been an internally motivated person and I'm living my life now for me and really trying to be disciplined in what I'm doing. Eating healthy, fixing my credit, figuring out really who I am. I've been reading books and listening to audio books like the \"Laws of Human Nature\" and now I'm reading \"The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself\" and its amazing.\n\nThe way I think has always been in this vein. I try to access situations logically and try to figure out why people do what they do and the root causes. Every conversation I have with someone, I'm putting myself into their head and trying to think how they think. Not to change what I'm going to say to them but how to say it to them based on how they think to make them understand what I'm saying in the best way possible for them.\n\nIn return, people all around me, co-workers, friends, family are constantly wanting my advice on something or to analyze it from my viewpoint.\n\nTo be honest with you guys, even though I've always been an pretty good writer, researcher, critical thinker, I was also a bit lazy or a procrastinator for whatever reason but I'm not like that anymore.\n\nI'm also an introvert. But I'm a really cool guy who has no issues being in a public setting, around a bunch of people or even talking a lot if I'm around people I think I can connect with. I don't have any issues speaking in front of a lot of people but generally I'm the quiet guy in the room unless someone says something to me.  I'm not the type of introvert who doesn't like to people around people just because. I'm more the type that just has more focus on how I want to plan out my life and execute those steps when I'm alone with no outside influences.  But I can get along with anyone, make friends with anyone if I really want to. People do tend to like to be around me because I'm cool, calm, generally a good person and I care about people. I do genuinely like helping people.\n\nI love children but I don't have any and I'm not in a relationship. I'm happy with my current job, (no stress), and I've been slowly rebuilding my credit. My student loans are the main thing that ruined them like many people so one thing I was trying to think of is how I'm going to go about paying for school this time.\n\nI'm fine with online classes and would probably prefer it as I have done it in the past and I tend to focus more when I'm at home alone.\n\nI like to read, I'm really into history, politics, science, nature, and just learning in general. I'll read or watch a documentary about pretty much anything.  I've always had a love of learning. I like to figure things out on my own or look up something and try to figure it out rather than ask others how to do something and I hate asking anyone for help.\n\nThat's a bit of background on me.\n\nI just feel this is probably the best time for me to do this. Its not like my life is set, I still struggle to pay my bills sometimes but I'm able to pay them, nothing is ever in danger of getting cut off and I'm generally able to afford what I like.\n\nMy biggest issue was constantly getting caught up in people around me and issues THEY have going on because I rarely have baggage and issues myself as far as drama, etc.\n\nAt this point, the main two people in my life where this is still an issue is my mother and my brother. My mom is just the type of person who is easily discouraged and its hard for her to see the light at the end of the tunnel in a lot of issues. At the same time, she's not a needy person, always been very independent. She's just had issues finding a job lately and so I've been helping her out with money, etc. I feel like once she's doing better financially, it will be a lot easier for me to truly focus stress free on what I want to do but again, she doesn't ask me for anything. I feel obligated because she's my mother. We haven't always gotten a long in the past but the older I've gotten and shown more responsibility, the closer we've gotten and we're more friends than mother and son.  And she's always been there in the past if I truly needed her. But at both of our cores, we're very independent and really like not having to ask anyone for anything.  She doesn't live with me right now, she lives with my brother.\n\nI think the main reason I was worried about the age was because from what I've read, it could take anywhere from 8-10 years to accomplish this and from a financial standpoint, I'm not at all completely equipped to take this on while I'm trying to get my life in order.  But at the same time, mentally and spiritually, I'm in the best place I've ever been in so from that standpoint I feel I'm ready to take this on and see it through until the end.\n\nOnce again, I truly appreciate all of you guy's responses. Stuff like this isn't easy for me to do as far as reaching out for advice. Everyone always wants to come to me for advice but I understand now that its ok for me to do the same.\n\nEdit #2 - I guess I should have said where I'm from. I'm born and raised in Indianapolis. Lived here all my life.\n\nEdit #3 - Based on my responses, I was never aware of the MSW and other similar programs. I'm leaning more towards this as it seems it will be more feasible for my situation. I appreciate all of the other responses as well and I wanted to make sure I responded to everyone who responded individually.\n\nDespite all that I've gone through, never really had a lot, I've always tried to remain a giving person, giving to charities, helping people whenever I can and not comparing where I am and where I think I should be to others. As someone said in the comments, don't compare your journey to anyone else. I'm generally a nice guy, I really care about people, what's going on in the world. I have a lot of compassion for those with less and those who are struggling.\n\nFor full disclosure and transparency, I'm a black man who's very passionate about things that affect the black community, black history and other related topics. But I embrace everyone and people seem to be drawn to my personality. Definitely was raised in a bad/poor neighborhood, never knew my father, but my mind has always been a lot more active than those around me and I never fell into the trap that so many around me did, whether it be drugs, crime, or just things that REALLY ruin people's lives. I thank my grandmother for that definitely.  My mom had me when she was very young, 16, but she's always been in my life and she's been through a lot, much more than me.  I've always been sensible in my thinking and view things generally in a very logical manner, rather than on an emotional level.  I think that's why many people come to me because they know I'll assess a situation, weigh every possible outcome (if I can), do some research and give a well, thought out response.  Definitely always think before I speak and always try to act rationally.\n\nI never expected this many responses and I really appreciate every comment.  You all have given me more direction than I could have ever dreamed of. Thank you.",

      "body": "Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist who attacks trigger warnings in an article and his book The Coddling of the American Mind. He discusses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to support his argument (many of the section titles are based on cognitive distortions, and David Burns is referenced frequently). How legitimate is he considered and the arguments he makes? Here are excerpts from an article:\n\n1. \"Emotional reasoning dominates many campus debates and discussions. A claim that someone’s words are “offensive” is not just an expression of one’s own subjective feeling of offendedness. It is, rather, a public charge that the speaker has done something objectively wrong. It is a demand that the speaker apologize or be punished by some authority for committing an offense.\"\n\n2. \"Students who call for trigger warnings may be correct that some of their peers are harboring memories of trauma that could be reactivated by course readings. But they are wrong to try to prevent such reactivations. Students with PTSD should of course get treatment, but they should not try to avoid normal life, with its many opportunities for habituation. Classroom discussions are safe places to be exposed to incidental reminders of trauma (such as the word violate). A discussion of violence is unlikely to be followed by actual violence, so it is a good way to help students change the associations that are causing them discomfort. And they’d better get their habituation done in college, because the world beyond college will be far less willing to accommodate requests for trigger warnings and opt-outs.\"",

      "title": "How can we improve statistics education in psychology?",
      "body": "Learning statistics is one of the most difficult and unenjoyable aspects of psychology education for many students. There are also many issues in how statistics is typically taught. Many of the statistical methods that psychology students learn are far less complex than those used in actual contemporary research, yet are still too complex for many students to comfortably understand. The large majority of statistical texbooks aimed at psychology students include false information (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2515245919858072)). There is very little focus in most psychology courses on learning to code, despite this being increasingly required in many of the jobs that psychology students are interested in. Most psychology courses have no mathematical prerequisites and do not require students to engage with any mathematical topics, including probability theory.\n\nIt's no wonder then that many (if not most) psychology students leave their statistics courses with poor data literacy and misconceptions about statistics (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2007.04.001) for a review). Researchers have proposed many potential solutions to this, the simplest being simply teaching psychology students about the misconceptions about statistics to avoid. Some researchers have argued that teaching statistics through specific frameworks might improve statistics education, such as teaching about t-tests, ANOVA, and regression all through the unified framework of general linear modelling (see [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/06/why-glms-should-be-a-priority-when-teaching-statistics/)). Research has also found that teaching students about the basics of Bayesian inference and propositional logic might be an effective method for reducing misconceptions (see [here](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1614-2241.4.4.152)), but many psychology lecturers themselves have limited experience with these topics.\n\nI was wondering if anyone here had any perspectives about the current challenges present in statistics education in psychology, what the solutions to these challenges might be, and how student experience can be improved. I'm not a statistics lecturer so I would be interested to read about some personal experiences.",

      "body": "This is a short message to educators teaching first year psychology, and any course that involves learning and behaviour. I apologise if this is not keeping in spirit with the rules of the sub. \n\nI’ve noticed more and more people using psychological terms incorrectly and poorly. One of the hot phrases at the moment is “learned helplessness”: https://reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/hps61r/_/fxu3kto/?context=1\n\nPeople seem to be dismissive of learning and behaviour as irrelevant to them, or even framing it as an immoral endeavour. \n\nThere was even a recent post here by an academic hellbent on proving that ABA therapy is linked to PTSD. Not a certain method in ABA therapy, just ABA therapy as a whole. Which is ridiculous. \n\nWe need to do better as educators and academics. The cognitive revolution happened decades ago. Many psychology students and even academics believe that supposedly, the cognitive revolution retired the field of learning and behaviour, and as such it is now a dead science. However, we still teach full courses on learning and behaviour, why?\n\nBecause it’s not dead. It is a field based on experimentally derived knowledge that have been verified over and over. The procedures work. And they are useful. And they can be dangerous. And we need to teach students this during undergrad, not after. \n\nFor some reason people think that learning and behaviour only happens when people are training animals. Or being trained like animals.  In fact, people are being conditioned by the environment around them constantly. If we do not recognise this, it can be dangerous to our society. Conditioning by the modern environment can warp our decision making, toy with our emotions, turn us into machines that constantly seek instant gratification. \n\nI’ve taught classes in both behaviour and cognition. Cognitive psychologists are egregious in dismissing behavioural processes. Every cognition course has a section that describes how Chomsky destroyed behavioural psychology. We all know that his critique of Skinner was mean-spirited and flawed, and even he did not dismiss all facets of learning and behaviour. We also know that very few issues in cognition can be investigated without considering learning processes. So why do we teach them while pretending that learning doesn’t exist?\n\nWe need to make it clear to students that behavioural psychology is not dead, and that every branch in psychology is meant to be seen as part of a whole, rather than factions.\n\nEdit: please allow me to link this [piece by Henry Roediger, a cognitive psychologist and then president of the APS](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/what-happened-to-behaviorism), who summarises the history of learning and behaviour and the attitude towards it from cognitive psychologists much better than I could.",

A proof to support my claim would be a wedding I remember attending at the age of 7, and there I had a full pledged conversation in German with one my relatives living abroad in Austria. Just to mention, up towards my 6th grade (which approximately is the time when our schools incorporate German language into the curriculum) I couldn't write, nor I could tell which grammatical form I was using. Now, as we've gone through developmental theories, my experience reminds me a lot of of the spontaneous concepts, Vygotsky was talking about, where a concept is saturated with experience, but lacks the necessary definition to it. My lecturer mentioned that she heard a few similar stories and exclusively with folks of my age, as we were the only generation exposed to these type of German cartoons (nowadays, everything is dubbed). She also mentioned that this is a hot topic right now, and that current research emphasizes the role of human contact and how becoming bilingual just by pure exposure to TV content is not possible, despite a number of people (including me) claiming different. To this day, I still speak fluent German. So, could anyone link a few articles about this topic and possibly state their opinion about it, as I'm quite intrigued after today's class.",

      "title": "Have you ever been hated for being a psychologist or psychology student?",
      "body": "A bit of background: I am not a psychologist, at least not yet; I majored in it in undergrad with a Bachelors but plan to grad school.  I have spoken with many of my professors, especially more venerated ones about academic politics and have come away with the impression that psychology is seen as “not a real science” from people from the hard sciences, and seen as a tool of the status quo from humanities, sociology, and anthropology.  Furthermore, I almost took a sociology class, but during office hours spoke to the professor who then after I said I was a psychology major told me to my face that psychology is not a real science and should stop pretending (he also suggested that sociology stopped pretending long ago and does not care anymore).  I once told a political science major about my major and he looked at me with disgust and said that political science people don’t like psychologists.  I spoke to a psychology guest lecturer in college who told me that she was part of a One Health team for an NGO to do some project in a developing country; she was surrounded by medical doctors who ignored her often.  An Anthropology professor also told me he thought psychology was too Western in scope to be trusted.\n\nIn the online spaces where I have gone to discuss certain hobbies there are often people who are highly educated, and even have graduate degrees or are Ph.D students.  People there do and have made fun of psychology even after I reveal that I have a degree in it; they like to share articles that are interesting about various topics of science and society, but once a psychology article is shown it is ripped like vultures on a carcass.  Among the people most vicious about this was someone who minored in anthropology but has a graduate degree in education and got extremely defensive when I questioned if he is critiquing psychological research studies in good faith when bringing up cultural psychology studies, especially after he critiqued a theory on one summary of the subject and interpreted the vocabulary in the most cynical way possible.  There have been other people and other places where people just outright said they think psychology is a sham.  I was also told in another place long ago that it was horrible that I was studying psychology but did not buy that people could choose to be happy or pull themselves by their bootstraps because I would demoralize my patients even after I stated to this same person more than a dozen times I was not going into clinical psychology or psychiatry.  \n\nI have become personally reluctant to tell people I majored in psychology because of this.  As someone who has studied psychology, I do understand the fear and hate of it, as well as the misinformation and pop culture psychology that have ruined its reputation.  I know the subject matter can be very uncomfortable and destructive to certain beliefs held sacred such as the learning type paradigm myth.  I know that historically people have suffered and been harmed by psychological research and psychiatry, and maybe not even very long ago at all.  Psychology is also extremely dangerous when applied in ways that benefit those on power, and I can understand treating it like some kind of evil or forbidden knowledge.  Most of all psychology is very internally contentious, and I have heard my psychology professors gossip and say bad things about other psychology professors.\n\nI would like to hear more about any times when some of you may have been hated for being a psychologist or studying psychology.",

So, basically unusable.\n\n1 data file with all the raw data included but no syntax or clear data cleaning protocol so it was next to impossible to replicate without knowing who the researcher cut out for their paper analyses\n\n1 dataset which was nicely formatted but I couldn't replicate the analyses in the paper for the life of me (probably my own lack of expertise, but there's also no syntax file or anything)\n\n1 dataset where the coding of the variables doesn't make sense based on the reported analyses. Specifically, one main outcome variable was a sum of four other variables; the outcome variable should have a range of 0-4 based on the results, but the four individual variables it was computed from are coded 1 or 2 (so the summed variable should have a range of 4-8). I had to recode the individual variables to be 0 or 1 to replicate the results in the paper.\n\n1 dataset that was cleaned and had lovely, clear syntax for all analyses in the paper -\nand it also comes from the lab I have an academic crush on (go VU Amsterdam!)\n\n(Also I should note, all of the papers from these projects were published in Psych Science and had the open data badge. So this was really disappointing to say the least.)\n\nSo, I'm just venting here, but if you're going to post your data on OSF, PLEASE include your syntax or some clear analysis information. The whole point is that other people should be able to replicate your results. Rant over.",

      "body": "Marriage has long been regarded as a cornerstone of society, but its elevation to a universal social norm deserves careful criticism. Treating marriage as an expected milestone rather than a personal choice pressures individuals into commitments they may not truly want or be prepared for. This expectation often reinforces rigid gender roles, where success and fulfillment are measured through marital status rather than personal growth, career achievement, or self-fulfillment. Moreover, it marginalizes those who prefer to remain single, pursue nontraditional partnerships, or focus on other life priorities. By upholding marriage as the standard path to respectability or happiness, society creates a false hierarchy that devalues diverse lifestyles and imposes conformity at the expense of individual freedom. True progress requires recognizing that happiness and stability can come in many forms, and that no single social institution should dictate the worth or direction of one’s life.",

      "body": "Abstract: In 14 studies, we tested whether political conservatives’ stronger free will beliefs were linked to stronger and broader tendencies to moralize and, thus, a greater motivation to assign blame. In Study 1 (meta-analysis of 5 studies, n 􏰀 308,499) we show that conservatives have stronger tendencies to moralize than liberals, even for moralization measures containing zero political content (e.g., moral badness ratings of faces and personality traits). In Study 2, we show that conservatives report higher free will belief, and this is statistically mediated by the belief that people should be held morally responsible for their bad behavior (n 􏰀 14,707). In Study 3, we show that political conservatism is associated with higher attributions of free will for specific events. Turning to experimental manipulations to test our hypotheses, we show the following: when conservatives and liberals see an action as equally wrong there is no difference in free will attributions (Study 4); when conservatives see an action as less wrong than liberals, they attribute less free will (Study 5); and specific perceptions of wrongness account for the relation between political ideology and free will attributions (Study 6a and 6b). Finally, we show that political conservatives and liberals even differentially attribute free will for the same action depending on who performed it (Studies 7a– d). These results are consistent with our theory that political differences in free will belief are at least partly explicable by conservatives’ tendency to moralize, which strengthens motivation to justify blame with stronger belief in free will and personal accountability.\n\nLink to non-paywalled  \nversion:[https://www.jimaceverett.com/publication/journal-article/jpsp2020/](https://www.jimaceverett.com/publication/journal-article/jpsp2020/)  \n\n\nVideo I made summarising the key studies, too: [https://youtu.be/AIlHvP8n2Cg](https://youtu.be/AIlHvP8n2Cg)",

      "body": "I hope this post is allowed here, remove it if it isn't.\n\nThis is a comment I wrote on a YouTube video about TikTok clips that cause secondhand embarrassment. I'd like to know what you guys think (preferably know and can point to sources/studies on) of these matters.\n\n(Referring to the video clips) Some of these are just people that are unattractive/ have disabilities (and are possibly unaware of that). If a conventionally attractive person did those same things, it would only be thought of as mildly weird or even cute.  \nSo, I guess the part that is embarrassing or causes second hand embarrassment, is at least partially, the unawareness of how you come across to others. If the people were aware of how they come across, owned it and directly or indirectly communicated that they are aware of that (and hence they themselves wouldn't take what they do and say that seriously), other people wouldn't find it (nearly as) embarrassing/ get secondhand embarrassment.  \nHence why comedy often isn't embarrassing. (Even if they are saying things and doing things that go outside of social norms (expected behavior) for their position in the social context of everyday life.)\n\nEmbarrassment stems from going (too far) outside of social norms (For example social norms for a certain age group, social norms for a certain work position, social norms for a certain culture, social norms for certain levels of attractiveness.). The same behavior is and isn't embarrassing depending on the age of the person, the culture, what the persons occupation is and how conventionally attractive they are. Hence the reason for \"ugly\" people being thought of as creepy for the same behavior as an attractive person would be thought of as romantic and kind for. Or a short, skinny and young person not being taken seriously (and it being viewed as funny or embarrassing) when they are angry, compared to older, taller and more muscular people. But then again, if you are at an age where you are expected to be mature, you also often won't be taken seriously if you act with/ express anger.  \nIt all has to do with (and going outside of) what is expected behavior of you in the current social context, based on the factors of age, gender, attractiveness, stature, muscle mass, body weight, culture, work position and social status.\n\nThe benefit of, and reason for, embarrassment and secondhand embarrassment is social cohesion. We need to \"force\" others and be \"psychologically forced\" to act according to our position in the social context for society/ the community to be a functioning unit. Embarrassment and secondhand embarrassment keep us in line.\n\nQuite an essay lol.\n\nI wrote this for myself, to make sense of what's actually going on, psychologically and socially, in cases of embarrassment and secondhand embarrassment.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I wrong on some points or do you agree with what I said?",

      "body": "It is possible to see social groups, families, or societies as spaces where people often prioritize belonging over deep self-awareness. Many individuals enter these circles with the assumption that their values and actions are inherently correct, which can lead to self-righteousness rather than reflection. Instead of questioning their own motives, biases, or flaws, they sometimes use the group as a shield to validate their choices and reinforce their sense of being right. True self-awareness, however, requires stepping back from collective approval and practicing humility and critical judgment, something not all people are willing to do when comfort and conformity seem easier than honest self-examination.",

      "title": "A big part of internet toxicity comes from people with Dark Tetrad traits. Given that these are mostly acquired at birth, and evidence suggests they are hard to change, can the internet ever be civil?",
      "body": "Researcher Anna Kurek believes those with dark traits are more likely to hurt others because they have a *false self-image*. The term encapsulates a person who doesn’t act as they would instinctively act and has an inaccurate view of who they are. For instance, let’s say I like a girl who is Montaigne’s number one fan, and to date her, I must like him, too. If I tell her I’m also his fan, **I would have to do activities I don’t genuinely enjoy**, such as re-reading Montaigne’s vague collection of essays.\n\nIn 2019, [Kurek worked with two](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563219301256#!) researchers to test if there were a link between three variables: \n\n1. Online disinhibition\n2. False self-perception\n3. Dark Tetrad personality traits\n\nThey asked 709 adolescents (50.5% female and 49.5% male) to answer various questionnaires. Then, they analyzed their habits, online behaviors, and personality traits. Because the results from the Machiavellism scale weren’t reliable, they did not measure it.\n\nResearchers found a positive correlation between narcissism and psychopathy and disinhibition online. Two reasons explain this link. First, self-centered and uncaring people are more likely to do evil online. They are more likely to spread rumors to gain attention or to humiliate others. Second, people with these traits tend to have a false self-image, and those that do are more prone to online disinhibition. \n\n>“It is possible that the characteristic impulsivity frequently recognized as a common trait of psychopathy may be exacerbated in digital settings when the fragile self-concept of these individuals is tested, resulting in an increased response to perceived provoked attacks or through the disinhibition of social restraints.” Kurek et al.\n\nThey also found sadists were also prone to online disinhibition. But it didn’t matter if the person had a false or accurate view of who they were—they simply acted evil. This suggests sadists could be the worse online pain inflictors, as pleasure drives them.\n\nMany studies back these findings.\n\nBefore, I explained how the [dopamine system](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/what-drives-human-aggression#:~:text=They%20also%20found%20the%20role%20that%20dopamine%20has%20in%20making%20a%20person%20violent.%20Dopamine%20releases%20when%20we%20do%20an%20activity%20that%20gives%20us%20pleasure.%20The%20more%20pleasure%20it%20releases%2C%20the%20more%20likely%20we%20will%20do%20that%20action%20in%20the%20future.) could instigate evil. It can encourage a person to repeat a pain-inducing action repeatedly. Those with dark traits might keep insulting Elon because their dopamine systems tell them to. \n\nMembers of a Behavior and Cognitive Science lab [found narcissists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886921008278#!) do hurt people. They even realized that the pain they cause could be worse if society excluded the narcissist. An explanation could be that once no one is there to support the narcissist, they have no one to fuel their false self-image. So they let evil inclinations rule their actions. \n\n[Another study on adolescents](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914006473#!) studied the link between psychopathy and cyber aggression. It controlled for gender and age and recruited 324 teenagers. They also found a positive correlation.\n\nCan we transform cyber-aggressive people into non-aggressive ones?\n\nDeliberate work can change social personality traits. \n\n[A 15-week study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-53132-001?doi=1) tracked changes in personality traits in 377 students. Subjects completed tasks that a person at the extremes of a trait commonly did. The underlying hypothesis was that by acting like someone you want to become, you could better resemble them. For example, say someone wants to be less neurotic. In that case, one day, they had to hug a close friend because that’s what a non-neurotic does. In the 15th week, analyses showed subjects improved in their desired personality dimension. \n\n>“Merely wanting to change does not appear to be sufficient to evoke trait growth; successfully changing one’s personality traits may require actively and successfully implementing behaviors to change oneself.” Hudson et al. \n\nI have reduced my neuroticism levels over the last four years without knowing this study. Neuroticism is a common trait among close family, and I despise it. So I meditate, follow stoic principles, like death awareness, and practice mindfulness. If I had to guess, I would have scored as mildly neurotic if I had taken a Big Five personality test back then. Today I’m not neurotic, [according to this scale](https://www.understandmyself.com/).\n\nUnfortunately, with dark personality traits, most people don’t tend to “get better.”\n\n[Elinor Greenberg](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-narcissism/201910/can-narcissists-become-less-self-centered#:~:text=Punchline%3A%20People%20with%20narcissistic%20personality,the%20new%20more%20desirable%20ones.), a therapist specializing in treating the narcissistic disorder, found that those that recognize their actions as wrong and take action to change can become less narcissistic. But she notes few people with this trait want to change or see themselves as flawed.\n\nThe evidence looks less optimistic for sadists and psychopaths.\n\n[A 2022 paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306624X211067089) put around 1200 people close to a psychopath through a 90-item survey. The questions assessed if the psychopaths they knew above 50 got better or worse over time[1](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/the-logic-behind-internet-haters#footnote-1). Less than 1% of surveyees said the person exhibited milder psychopathic behavior. “As he aged,” one participant said, “he seemed to care less about hiding his behavior, and he seemed to openly enjoy being cruel.”  \n\nThere is not much research on whether sadists can improve with age, but a 2019 study might shed light. [An experimental psychologist](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218816327) took 2255 people through eight studies to determine if they could harm people. They found sadists could inflict pain and gain pleasure from it but experience emotional pain after they stop doing the pain-inflicting. At first sight, this suggests a sadist will keep inflicting pain to regain the “feel rewarded\" state. But, assuming the person wants to change, they could raise their odds of doing so by reminding themselves of the consequences of inflicting evil.\n\nI like to dream of an internet where non-aggressive debate can exist. One where I post a polarizing opinion, people oppose my thesis, and, after some back and forth, we develop a more robust hypothesis. But such an internet doesn’t seem attainable in the short term. Personality traits, which may be inherited, impact an individual’s odds of being aggressive online. Some evidence shows the levels of a negative personality trait can decrease. But, since change happens when individuals often unwilling to change decide to do it, and a society reluctant to help them, I’m more likely to be called a moron tomorrow than to make an online friend.",

      "body": "The ways people mourn are shaped by the orientation of their cultural values — whether rooted in individualist traditions that prioritize autonomy, or in collectivist traditions that center on shared values, communal ties, and spiritual continuity.\n\nThis perspective is especially important for psychosocial support in healthcare. While existing grief frameworks are valuable, it is equally important to consider how cultural context shapes the meanings, expressions, and coping pathways of grief. Doing so opens space for care models that address not only individual adjustment but also the social, communal, and spiritual dimensions that sustain people in loss.\n\nOur two articles in OMEGA — Journal of Death and Dying (SAGE Publishing), a Scopus and PubMed-indexed international journal in grief, death and dying, examine Filipino digital mourning through both lived experiences and theoretical expansion — from documenting how digital platforms like Facebook are used to express grief and sustain communal rituals, to building on and expanding Kübler-Ross, Continuing Bonds, Narrative Identity, and Relational Models Theories using Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory — particularly the Individualism–Collectivism dimension — as conceptual scaffolding.\n\nGrounded in the Philippine experience yet relevant to other collectivist contexts, they frame grief as a “Relational-Spiritual Praxis” — where mourning is relational, community-based, and spiritually sustained, even in the digital age. This has important implications for designing culturally sensitive psychosocial interventions in palliative care and bereavement support.\n\n📖 First Article (Exploratory Study)\n\nOfficial Journal Article Site: https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228251331343\n\n\nOpen Access Repositories:\n\n1.

      "body": "I've been reading about a lot of different psychological topics. Mainly media studies and self-determination theory. I've slowly been developing a hypothesis in my head but it's hard to articulate, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense. Here it goes;\n\nIt seems like, especially in the modern era but for a large portion of our history as a species, we go from cradle to grave with someone telling us how to think and how to behave. Ostensibly this is because humans aren't competent on their own and require someone to keep them on the proper course. But is this a self-fulfilling prophecy? Some may be hesitant to allow people more independent lifestyles for fear of belief in pseudoscience and fake news, which I understand completely. But that's a huge problem *now.* Is it because people have too much independence or not enough? Perhaps people fall into these traps not because they followed their own path, but because a charismatic figure told them it was the right way, or because their parents did, or something else like that.\n\nIf people are consistently raised to make their own desicions and given a large degree of autonomy, are they more successful in their later years? Are they more or less likely to believe in pseudoscience and fake news? How successful are sudbury schools and other democratic education schemes that focus on giving children freedom?",

Masking is exhausting and tiring, but at the end of the day, you probably need it to survive.\n\nIt’s harder to figure out those patterns yourself because you don’t experience them firsthand: you’re just watching. I’m trying to understand if there are any social psychology books or resources that have helped people study humans and understand how they function, that I can turn into an algorithmic or protocol-based ways of understanding people. Because you can build protocols for certain things, how people behave, what they do, but most autistic people have to make those from scratch, based on observation and survival. I’m just trying to cut that process in half.\n\nI'm fairly decent at talking to people, getting interested in connecting, and I can usually get to surface-level stuff. But I realize I have trouble forming long-term friendships or connections (especially transactional ones) because those usually happen one-on-one, in person and I can’t just watch other people do it in public and mimic it. Also why I have trouble dating. \n\nSecond problem: I don’t understand how much people mean what they say. Like, how much leeway do people take when they talk? I tend to do everything by the book: if there’s a rule, I follow it. But people seem to bend rules all the time. What’s the general risk tolerance or social flexibility people have?\n\nSo if anyone has books, videos, posts, anything that helped you observe patterns, understand people better, or build systems for interacting, please let me know.\n\nI know it's not a 100% but establishing some fundamentals also drastically reduces burnout. \n\nI basically want to use this to understand how neurotypicals work. Social language seems to be the system people use to translate what they want, what they’re offering, and what they’re allowed to access — jobs, friendships, resources, support. I don’t speak that language naturally. I’m just trying to find the sources that will help me learn it, so I can eventually function in the world on my own terms.",

Are these directions appealing or promising for the field?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights! 🙂",

It involves watching people in a professional workplaces become convinced that simple and (in other situations)  familiar tasks are more involved and difficult when they understand that they have an expert around who’s job might conceivably encompass the task…\n\nI have two examples for clarity. \n\nOne is I observed multiple people in a workplace insist they couldn’t print out some collateral materials themselves and that the graphic designer had to do it for them. To the point where they called the designer at home on the weekend and asked them to log in remotely to print the material. I asked the designer what was so difficult about it and she was genuinely perplexed The media was 11x17 and needed to print on special paper, which involved opening the drawer and inserting the paper then literally opening a pdf and hitting print. I’d say they were just being lazy, except these people seemed genuinely distressed that they would somehow screw this up. Here’s the thing: they All were absolutely fine printing other things themselves. They knew how to use the office equipment.\n\nAnother situation was one I was more personally involved in. I was minding a technical rehearsal for a professional stage show. My job was to ensure the stage lighting was working (think moving lights and complicated equipment). In the middle of the rehearsal I was paged to the house by a very competent person, who was having a melt down because the light on her desk wasn’t working anymore. This was a small, desk lamp like you might purchase at IKEA or target. It had come unplugged… I plugged it in for her and she went on with her work as if this was all normal. Completely unfazed by the fact that she had been unable to figure out something that if it had occurred in her home I am certain she could have handled without batting an eye…\n\n\nSo I guess my question is… is there a name for this? Is it something that’s been observed before and studied? I feel like I could produce a lot of examples of it, and I’m not really satisfied with “they are just being lazy”. I feel like it’s specific to people losing competence and doubting the obvious when surrounded in environments where everyone has a role or an expertise.",

These mechanisms can take several forms, such as adding more supportive beliefs that outweigh dissonant beliefs, reducing the importance of the conflicting belief or changing the belief.\n\n[Moral disengagement](https://oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/moral-disengagement/) refers to the process where an individual or group of people distances themselves from the normal or usual ethical standards of behavior and then become convinced that new unethical behaviors are justified due often to some perceived extenuating circumstances.\n\nBoth are avoidance mechanisms people use to avoid negative emotions and cognitions derived from the inconsistencies between behaviors and moral principles. But Bandura wrote moral disengagement years after Festinger's original cognitive dissonance studies. I wonder why he wanted to coin a new term and what is the difference between these two mechanisms.\n\nCan we say that, moral disengagement is a form of cognitive dissonance reduction mechanism?",

      "body": "I’m interested in viewing human societies as having a “collective intelligence” (CI). What I mean by this is not literally that human societies are alive, or that they work like brains. I just mean the following:\n\n1. Human societies, groups, and communities solve problems, like “how do teams solve complex problems,” “how do children self-organize during games,” “how do people with opposing views debate political and social issues.”\n2. CI emerges from the complex web of interactions of multiple agents in such a way that the whole can appear more intelligent than the individual. CI is \"bottom up,\" not just \"top down.” Many people can be quite selfish. Few people are consciously thinking about all of the problems society needs to solve, let alone the best solutions to these problems. Yet CI nevertheless emerges from people’s negotiations.\n3. Intelligence implies flexibility - when new problems arise, communities can adapt. This adaptation can occur quickly, or it can take 100 years or even more.\n4. We can understand how collectives think by understanding human psychological needs: needs for things like trust, belonging, expression, esteem, learning, power, and autonomy. We would also like to understand the dynamics of how these needs are acted out in cognition and behavior.\n5. CI can be a property of nation-states, families, teams, church groups, social classes, racial identity groups, etc. Power can be unequally distributed between these groups, leading to unfair outcomes.\n\nOne question I have is: What psychological needs inform collective decision making? Would you have any points to add to or modify (1-5) above?",

      "body": "Toxic frankness is often disguised as honesty, but in reality, it can be a shield for hypocrisy. People who claim to be “just being frank” sometimes use this excuse to insult, belittle, or expose others while avoiding accountability for their own flaws. They present themselves as truth-tellers, yet their harsh words rarely come from genuine concern and often reveal double standards. This kind of frankness is toxic because it does not encourage growth or mutual understanding—it simply breeds resentment and mistrust. Worse, it hides the speaker’s hypocrisy, since they demand openness from others while refusing to reflect on their own actions. True honesty is rooted in respect and consistency, not in cruelty masked as straightforwardness.",

Although I’m very passionate about social psychology and pursuing a career in research I have to worry about my financial future. I’ve googled and seen a lot of different salaries for professors and researchers but it all seems all over the place and not very accurate. So I am wondering what would the pay look like if I were to be a professor directly out of my PhD? What if I didn’t want to pursue a career in academia, what other careers would I be looking at that would pay well with a social psych PhD? Any advice or tips are appreciated thank you!",

      "body": "Social pressure can be destructive because it often forces individuals to act against their own values, beliefs, or personal readiness in order to gain approval or avoid criticism. While society thrives on shared norms, the unhealthy side of social pressure arises when it silences individuality and punishes those who choose a different path. People may take jobs they dislike, engage in habits they are uncomfortable with, or pursue lifestyles they never wanted, simply to avoid judgment. This constant pressure strips away authenticity and breeds stress, insecurity, and resentment. True growth happens when individuals are free to make decisions guided by their own principles, not the expectations of others. Resisting social pressure is not rebellion; it is a stand for self-respect and the right to live genuinely.",

      "body": "I’ve noticed in my society, and later in other societies, that people often use sarcasm or humor to cope with national issues such as poverty or unemployment. They use sarcasm and dark humor to deal with these problems.\n\n\nWhile it might seem like a way to cope, I saw it as a way to belittle the impact of these issues by mocking them, which prevents people from collectively facing their real problems. And I saw this happen again and a again for serious national issues in my society. When issues are mocked or belittled, it’s easier to avoid dealing with them.\n\n\nI compared this to a stereotype I saw online that the British have less of a sense of humor, but I’ve also known a stereotype we have, that British people tend to address and resolve their issues more quickly than other societies.\n\n\nIn turn, this habit of sarcasm can make individuals less likely to take responsibility for the problems they cause in their personal relationships. It may even lead to more problems because people don’t think deeply about the impact of their actions, and going meh, before doing bad actions.\n\n\nAnd so I came to the conclusion that when issues are mocked or belittled on social level, it causes collective avoidance and laziness to stand for these issues, and going further, it enables individuals to recreate them without fear of consequences.\n\n\nI’ve heard of the concept of social sarcasm toward problems, and I’d like to read more about it.\n\n\nAlso, how does this mindset affect how we resolve issues between people and prevent us from finding real solutions?\n\n\n========\n\n- i agree its hidden aggression, but I’m saying aggression is energy that can be steered towards solving a present issue instead.\n\n- i agree sarcasm and humor is needed to lift tension from many topics, so I don’t mean using sarcasm in conversations about things that happened in the past.\n\n- i agree that most cases sarcasm is used with present issues when we can’t talk about them out of fear.",

As I am sure academic systems and markets differ from region to region, I would love to hear from people in Europe, UK, US, Oceania (or anywhere else where English is spoken in the academic setting :) )   \n(Apologies in advance, this post will be long because at this point I thought about it so much and looked up so many things online and read many books that I don't know how to make sense of all the information anymore). \n\nFor some **context** I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in communication and media studies with a minor in psychology in continental Europe. In the course of my degree, I had the opportunity to do some quantitative research projects and found, that I am really enjoying the whole research process. Additionally, I have worked as a tutor, research assistant and teaching assistant in the department of media psychology, which I LOVED. Because of this, I aim to do a PhD (focus on quantitative) to hopefully continue to work in academia and my current grade average (GPA 4.0/first class honours) seems to be appropriate for this path. I am highly aware that the academic job market is competitive and have therefore already looked into possible alternative careers for a social science phd such as working in think tanks, consulting, market research or government which I intend to intern in during the course of my Master's (and possibly PhD). \n\nNow to my problem: **Since communication studies is a social science field that is quite interdisciplinary (with influences from sociology, political science and psychology), I am not sure what would be the right path to take at this point, since all the areas I am interested in seem like an intersection** of all of the above (or at least possible to investigate from all the perspectives above). In very broad terms, I am interested in the following: \n\n\\- **Formation of beliefs/opinions and attitudes (think ELM etc.), social conditions of political polarisation, social cohesion.**   \n\\- I think this area is interesting because it seems like it is possible to apply the theoretical frameworks to many different kinds of social problems, e.g. climate change, vaccination, misinformation, digital transformation, etc. while also doing research on the underlying \"basic frameworks\". Does this make sense of am I not thinking the right way about this?  \n\\- Am I correct in thinking that this is most in line with social psychology? (But also communications & political science?)   \n\\- What is the academic job market like in social psychology for these topics?   \n\\- Would this research profile also enable me to get jobs in public policy /thinktanks as an alternative to academia?   \n\n\n\\- **Social/political implications of internet platforms & AI.**    \n\\- I find this path appealing since research in it could be useful to inform policy but also because the digital it is such a big aspect of the social world and can be examined through so many different theoretical lenses and there seems to be a lot of academic \"groundwork\" to do in the area.  \n\\- It seems like there are a lot of research institutes/groups internationally that focus on these issues (e.g. Berkman Klein Centre, OII, Humboldt Institute for Internet & Society and many more...), so from an outside perspective, this appears to be a  growing problem area within the social sciences. Also, I came across positions at tech companies such as Microsoft or Facebook aimed at social scientists that focus on \"responsible\" digitalisation/ policy or do internal research. Think tanks seem to hire people that are experts on these issues as well. Overall, it looks like it is the more promising job market than the first area of interest that I mentioned. Is this assessment realistic? I am unsure if I am just impressed by the \"hype\" and now think that it's in demand lol.   \n\\- Which of the disciplines that could be looking at such questions (I assume political science, communication, sociology) are the most \"hireable\" in the academic job market? E.g. I have the feeling that as a sociologist, one could easily work in a communications department, but the opposite is not the case. At the same time, I read that communications as a field is growing and therefore have \"good\" prospects for phds looking for faculty positions. Is that true?\n\n\\- What are good next steps I could take? I thought about doing an interdisciplinary Master's (like behavioural science or social science) that will allow me to keep my options open but I have heard that interdisciplinary Master's could be an issue when applying for phd positions. What is your experience with this? Also, is it generally possible to \"switch\" the social science field for the phd after the masters? \n\nI would be very grateful for any advice on any of the above. If any (or all) of the above don't make much sense please point this out to me as I'd also be grateful to know if I'm hugely overthinking everything. Thanks again in advance for your response!",

      "title": "Questions about the psychology of Moral Panics.",
      "body": "I recently finished reading Mistakes Were Made, But Not by Me and a few books on Moral Panics.\n\nDr Travis explains that self-justification is a key ingredient in Moral Panics, and I definitely see that, but there’s other things going on. I was really hoping there was a book out there explaining the psychology of Moral Panics, or at least some research papers, but I've found very little. So any literature you have on the subject, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nHere’s my very amateur analysis of Moral Panics along with the questions I have:\n\nIn a Moral Panic, it seems like there’s always a desire for people to believe in the myth. The older generation doesn’t like the new media; rock music, comic books, videogames, D&D. So when the idea gets passed around that videogames make kids violent, or that comic books turn kids gay, they feel like their dislike of the new medium is justified.\n\nWhy is that though? I feel like self-justification explains why people continued to believe the myth, but doesn’t explain why the myth was embraced in the first place. Maybe they are dissonant because they hate rock music, but they know they don’t have a legit reason to hate the young rockers. They don’t want to think they’re just being a curmudgeon.\n\nOr is it just confirmation bias? “I KNEW that rock music was giving kids brain damage! Finally I have my proof!”\n\nIs this a case of misattribution of arousal as well? They think they’re feeling hunch that something sinister is afoot, but in fact it’s just irritation at something new and unfamiliar.\n\nIn the moral panic of the 1980’s when school teachers were being accused of sexually abusing children, I feel like many of the therapists had an eagerness to believe that these children had been sexually abused because it gave them a kind of Sherlock Holmes high. They got an ego-boost for thinking they had cracked the case on some massive Satanist plot.\n\nIt partly makes sense to me that the parents would believe the doctor as they are an authority figure. But even so, the parents seemed too eager to believe this. I would have expected them to go through a denial phase after hearing their kids got violated by devil-worshippers. Maybe they did and the books I read skipped that part. Still, was there maybe an incentive for them to believe it?\n\nIn an article I read called Why You Secretly Enjoy Getting Angry, the psychologist-author explains how getting angry often gives us a sense of righteous validation. I wonder if feeling like a victim does the same thing. You know you’re the good guy because the person who wronged you was definitely the bad guy. Here's the article: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201811/why-you-secretly-enjoy-getting-angry](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201811/why-you-secretly-enjoy-getting-angry)\n\nDisplacement might also be an incentive to believe in the myth. During the Red Scare of the 1940’s, the average American was worried about and angry at the Commies, but probably felt powerless against an enemy an ocean away. It would be nice if your enemy lived right next door. If only your asshole neighbor turned out to be a Russian spy.\n\nMaybe part of the incentive to believe it is that we love to have an enemy. We have a competitive nature. When presented with a made-up enemy, we're eager to believe it.\n\nI’m sure narcissists are always a catalyst in any Moral Panic. The Moral Panic is a perfect opportunity for them to prove what a hero they are. So they end up unknowingly fanning the flames of everyone else’s paranoia.\n\nAnyway, that's about the best I can figure out. I'm fascinated by this topic, but I'm just a student. This is as far as my limited knowledge got me so far. Any input is appreciated.",

As I’ve been studying my practice test scores are in the mid 150s for verbal and high 150s on my quantitative. I am aiming for at least 160 on each but since these practice exams are diagnostic there is no guarantee.

      "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been reading up on some recent studies about Alzheimer’s, and I wanted to share and get your thoughts. One of the most interesting findings comes from a recent randomized controlled trial, where people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia were put on a strict lifestyle intervention program. This involved a vegan diet, regular exercise, stress reduction (like yoga/meditation), and social support groups. Over 20 weeks, those who followed this routine either improved or maintained their cognitive health, while the control group saw a decline. What's cool is that biomarkers like amyloid beta protein ratios (which are linked to Alzheimer's plaques) also showed improvement.\n\nEven though the sample size was small, the results are encouraging, suggesting that lifestyle changes could have a real impact on slowing down Alzheimer’s progression. On the other hand, some experts believe larger and longer studies are needed before drawing conclusions.\n\nAnother interesting study I came across focuses on genetic factors, specifically the APOE4 gene. People with two copies of this gene are at a much higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s. But even then, lifestyle and environmental factors can still influence when and how severely symptoms appear.\n\nI’m curious to hear what you all think about this. Do you believe lifestyle changes can really help manage or prevent Alzheimer's? Have any of you or your loved ones tried something similar?\n\nSources:\n\n1. Study on Lifestyle Changes and Alzheimer’s\n2. Genetic Factors and APOE4\n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

When, in a movie, the villain gets defeated, we celebrate it. \n\nNobody feels bad when someone who deserves what happened to them, gets what they deserve. \n\nIf everyone is bad, everyone deserves what's coming for them. That's how the antisocial misanthropist thinks. \n\nMisanthropy is a way to evade the moral repercussions of our actions!\n\nIt takes a moral logic: All bad people deserve whatever bad thing happens to them → attributes it to everyone → It allows you to commit necessary atrocities to survive without succumbing to the guilt cause by those actions.\n\nDo you have any evidence that goes against/in favour of this idea? What do you think?\n\nFootnote: I want to hear what social psychologists have to say about this.",

The closest things I’ve found thus far have been:\n\n* Research on lay beliefs in “pure evil” and “pure good” ([https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213496282](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213496282)), which isn’t quite the same as what I’m describing here (since a belief in pure evil per these authors’ definition involves \\[in part\\] viewing others as motivated by a pure desire to see others suffer, whereas I’d be interested in a broader range of dispositional explanations as well, such as an exceptional “weakness in character”/susceptibility to social pressure or something along these lines). \n* Research on “attributional complexity” (e.g., [https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.4.875](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.4.875)) which seems sort of like what I’m describing here but I haven’t seen it applied to this specific context.",

      "body": "In social psychology, [naïve realism][1] is the human tendency to believe that we see the world around us objectively, and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, irrational, or biased. It is considered as one of the four major insights in the field.  \n\nThe three tenets that make up a naïve realist:  \n \n* Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.  \n* Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and interpret it in a rational manner.  \n* Assume that others who do not share the same views must be ignorant, irrational, or biased.    \n  \n\nThis makes conversations frustrating, because no side intentionally wants to claim that they know the whole truth, yet the talk is still heated because the naïve realists in both will always kick in. For example, when we break a rule to do something beneficial for others, in our mind we are helping them, but it is very easy to be misconstrued as, well, breaking the rule. We see our action as selfless, but since they perceive it as selfish, they refuse to help us to help them. And this is very frustrating.   \n\nNaïve realism is just one component that lead to frustrations in communication. There are many more: illusion of transparency (or the curse of knowledge), cognitive load, tip of the tongue phenomenon, attitude, etc. To deal with such frustrations, we tend to use clichés like \"let's agree to disagree\", or \"let's bygone be bygone\". There is an element of truth in them, but they don't fully satisfy us. Something is unfulfilled, but we cannot pinpoint exactly what.  \n\nTo unify and attack all such problems in one place, I propose a theory and would like to have your feedback. It spans not only in social psychology, but also cognitive linguistics, decision making, and clinical psychology. The applications of the theory and the questions that each of them trying to answer will be:  \n\n \n* **Analogy:**  Why do analogies help us understand a problem we don't understand? How to reason with analogy without making logical fallacy?  \n* **Writing:** How to explain a concept when the novice really lacks background? What does it mean to have a transformative writing? What does \"big picture\" really mean?  \n* **Finding the balance point:** Why are efforts to be adaptive become maladaptive? Why is it hard to balance between disciplinary and flexibility? How to stop the indecisiveness without worrying of doing wrong?  \n* **Communication & perspective taking:** Why do people keep misunderstand each other? Why do others keep distorting our words? Why don't we realize that we are distorting theirs? How to solve it when it happens?  \n* **The cold gaze:** How to see your core value when your mind is clouded with fantasies, ruminations, resentments, or fears?    \n  \n\nThe underlying philosophies are Taoism, Buddhism, postmodernism, and perhaps romanticism, but you don't need to know any of them. You can also read my another posts that are more tuned for folks with background in [Eastern philosophy][2] or [cognitive science][3].  \n\nHere is the link: [A theory of perspective][4].

      "body": "People who judge others for posting well-written content by assuming it was created through artificial intelligence reveal a deeper issue in social psychology—resistance to change and insecurity toward intellectual growth. In the modern digital age, AI has become a tool that enhances human expression, allowing individuals to convey meaningful and insightful thoughts more clearly. However, those who quickly dismiss such posts as “AI-made” often do so to maintain a sense of superiority or to invalidate others’ intelligence. This behavior reflects the concept of defensive attribution, where people criticize what they do not understand to protect their self-image. Instead of celebrating the spread of thoughtful ideas, they create stigma against those who use modern tools to learn and communicate better. From a social psychology perspective, this form of judgment discourages intellectual openness and collaboration. When someone shares a message that inspires understanding or reflection, the focus should be on the depth of the idea, not the tool used to express it. True progress lies in recognizing substance over source—commending meaningful contributions rather than pulling people down for how they chose to craft them.",

However, I've heard that online masters may not be a viable way to continue your education/will make it harder to get into PhD programs and harder to find jobs. Is this true? Is it worth pursuing an online degree, or should I wait to continue my education until I am more sure of my living situation? Is Walden legit? If it isn't, are there any online programs that are?",

      "body": "I went through some chapters from Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles, 3rd edition and what really stuck out was the choice of topic for each of the chapters and their overall organisation. For a book that presents itself as a handbook of basic principles, its presentation was unecessarily complex and ambiguous. The principles reflected (or should be reflected in the chapters) seem more like specialised advanced issues and not very intuitive at times (e.g., Indirect Reciprocity, Gossip, and Reputation-Based Cooperation \\_ that's three topics crammed together and none of them seems to be a principle of anything). \n\nNow, I am going through the 2nd edition and honestly, just by looking at the content table, it seems to be much more intuitive, very informative, and is actually about the basic principles of social psychology. Chapters titled \"Expectancy\", \"Feelings and Phenomenal Experiences\", \"Social Psychology of Leadership (which doesn't seem to matter at all in the 3rd edition)\" are clear and to the point. Now compare it to these titles from the 3rd edition: \"The Biological Foundations and Modulation of Empathy\"; \"Cultural Systems: Attunement, Tension, and Lewinian Social Psychology\"; Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Reduction: Three Guiding Principles\"; etc. They are just too convoluted. The chapters themselves sometimes take certain directions that were not very obvious from their titles. \n\nI guess the general take away here is that the 2nd edition is far superior to the 3rd edition. I'd suggest reading the 2nd edition first and perhaps the 3rd edition for a more nuanced discussion on specific issues in social psychology.",

Tools like Woebot and Wysa are already providing 24/7, affordable support, and some studies suggest they can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nBut there are ethical concerns. Can AI really understand the complexity of human emotions? Can algorithms develop empathy? And then there’s the issue of data privacy.

      "body": "# I'm sorry that this is long, it's just details about why I'm asking. No need to read the details in order to give input. Anything is welcomed!\n\n**Preface: There is a newer person in my life that is steadily around my mother and little brother. My mom is letting her stay in one of the bedrooms and has been for about 8 months. This began before I started being around my family more often, as I've only just moved back to the area. I could just be protective of my family, but I really do get weird vibes from her.**\n\nGenuinely every time she converses with me, she tells me a grandiose story about her life; all of the stories she tells about herself are to the extreme end of something \"incredible\" she's done. The stories are \\*always\\* (I'm serious) about how she is \\*always\\* the pristine one and the other people are \\*consistently\\* doing only bad.\n\nOne time she even said her grandmother was the creator of a quite famous organization, when I knew she wasn't because the org is something I've known about since I was a child, with my father even telling me the history of how it started since he volunteered for years; I even looked it up just to make sure I wasn't missing/forgetting anything.\n\nShe has told inconsistent stories about a job she had. She had been paying a small amount of rent ($100) to my mom prior to being fired from that job. She had told my mom and little brother that she had not been having her boyfriend go in the kitchen near the end of her shift while she was closing (part of why she was fired. there are cameras, management saw, and it's obviously against the rules of her job. She also said management said that they saw her taking food, items, etc). My mother told me this before I even spoke to this woman. Then, after I started talking to her, I asked her about the place because I was looking for a job in the area. She told me a different story, about how she HAD been bringing her boyfriend to the back, and how it was \"okay\", despite the rules put into place and it was frowned upon by management to break those rules. Also she told me her mom is now supporting her, which IDC, but it sounds like my mom and little brother don't know this. Especially since after I said, \"It's awesome she's supporting you! I'm glad you are able to get that.\" her eyes widened and she seemed weird. Maybe my comment was just unneeded, though. She also gave far more details about the job experience, and I doubt this specific job was great, likely exhausting, etc, but still. She's also always out drinking, so my mom knows she has \\*something\\* from somewhere.\n\nAfter I told her I used to help a friends mom out a little bit on her farm while spending time with the friend, she bursted out quickly with a story about how she grew up on a horse farm and that her grandmother kidnapped her, which was the reason why she was at the farm. However, every other story about her childhood and teenage years was about how she grew up solely with her mother, in a town where she was \"brought in as a friend to a black gang (her wording)\" from her school despite them \"hating white girls\" because she \\*kept\\* saving and beating up boys who were hurting people. These guys she specifically said were athletic and she is tiny and like 115lbs at most.\n\nShe constantly tries flirting with my brother both with comments and actions with her body, including in front of his girlfriend. The girlfriend is clearly uncomfortable and my brother has seemed a bit uncomfortable too, including shifting away from her or ignoring the verbal flirting. Also talking to me about her nipples and other body parts and how she is tiny and petite and has nice boobs.\n\nThere's more but I really don't need to keep giving examples.\n\nI assume she was traumatized growing up, and that's why she speaks like this and also why she acts like that towards my brother. However I feel uncomfortable and I worry that my mom is being taken advantage of, I feel weird about how she is with my brother, and also feel bad for his girlfriend he's been with for 3 years.",

      "body": "I’m looking for resources for clinical treatment of two related phenomena:\n\n1. Members of marginalized groups who isolate themselves from that same group to avoid risk and lack of safety being associated with that group increases the chances of being targeted. \n\n2. Members of isolated groups who make a point of distinguishing themselves from other members of that same group in order to avoid being targeted in the way that those other members are. \n\nI’m a trans woman. One of the phenomena that exists among trans women is the “Highlander effect,” “there can be only one.” This means that any space only has room for one trans woman, because the existence of one trans woman in that space makes it much more likely for other trans women in that space to be read, recognized as being trans. This leads to isolation because trans woman may avoid associating with other trans women seeking safety from society at large. This is the first phenomenon. \n\nIt’s not limited to trans women or trans people at large. Any marginalized community who may seek safety by blending in as a member of the dominant group may have this. For example, light skinned Latinx people or Black people. \n\nThe second phenomenon tends to be more for people where blending in as in-group is not an option. This includes respectability, members of marginalized groups who behave in a way less likely to be judged by the dominant group and publicly distancing themselves from the bulk of their marginalized group. “I’m one of the good ones.”\n\nI’m specifically looking for terminology that will help me find resources to heal. Has this been studied clinically? Is anyone aware of any support groups around this?",

I would like to consult with you guys on how to boost my current profile. My main concern is that I do not have highly relevant backgrounds. I have a BA in international relations from Thailand (GPA 3.64/4.00), and an MRes in Conflict studies from the UK (marks are not yet released in many subjects due to boycott, but my grades in the first semester were just around 52/100 on average but I did quite well on the second semester). I also interned in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for four months, and volunteered in a human-rights organization for seven months.\n\nI would like to know based on these backgrounds, how could I boost my current profile so that I have a higher chance to get accepted into top-ranked Social Psychology PhD Programs in the US?\n\nFor example, what extracurricular, work, or research experiences should I seek to add to my profile? Should I get another diploma or BA in social psychology to build a strong foundation before applying for the program? Currently, I plan to apply for a research assistantship in conflict related-topic for a year. Is that a good move? I\nalso think of taking quantitative research-related\ncourses/diploma (such as statistics) for a year before applying to the program (as I do not have strong foundation in statistics, I only had one introduction to quantitative research class during MRes which I received distinction mark). Is this also a good plan? Will it be a waste of time to do all these a.k.a. should I just apply to the program despite my not-highly-relevant backgrounds?\n\nThanks so much for your insightful advice, lovely\nRedditors!",

My mom was extremely affected by this and began having convulsions up to 17 times a day each lasting 10-45 minutes. She was hospitalized, her medications reviewed and sent home. The seizures continued.. for 3 years now. Her quality of life began to decrease immensely, her memory, mobility, personality all affected. I’m a psychology graduate myself so I had a feeling this was not just a case of epilepsy, as no medication would control it. She eventually had a EKG/EGG which showed her convulsions we’re not se hire related. I had been assuming (after intense research) this is a case of PNES. I recently got her in to see a psychiatrist, and he had changed all her meds and is starting on CBT, and had confirmed it was PNES. Now I’m just wondering has anyone else experienced or have any experience with PNE. I have never heard of it before this so I would like to learn more from real life experiences . Thanks",

With regard to Alex's knowledge of Ben's general aversion to confrontation, would we say that Alex is a \"primary source\" in the first (\"direct\") scenario, and a \"secondary source\" in the second (\"indirect\") scenario? Or are there better terms or ways to describe this? (e.g., better terms for \"experience\", \"direct\", \"indirect\", \"primary source\", and \"secondary source\")\n\n(I haven't found anything on this on Google nor this subreddit.)\n\nEdit: I wrote \"John\" instead of \"Ben\" in one sentence.

I've repeated that myself quite a few times.\n\nBut I've long since lost the original source, and it was easily long enough ago that I may not be remembering it correctly.\n\nI've been searching on Google Scholar and elsewhere, and all I can find is essentially the opposite (and much happier) result - that awareness of attribution errors and other biases can lead to a reduced tendency to make those errors and a less judgemental attitude towards other peoples actions.\n\nSo - did I imagine that claim of using the FAE as a stick to beat others with? I'm pretty sure it's potentially real because I'm pretty sure I've been guilty myself, but is there a good research source for that?

By the way, the individualism is one of the bases of socioeconomic liberalism. For example, because in a individualist society everyone have their own and personal value, they don't born in a secure group, making very dangerous question the dominant discourse by the afraid to be alone after the conflict, making like an obligated compliance and because that apparently is the norm, eventually it will be conformity in the future as a learned behavior. That in a collective society should not happen because when u are in a group, everyone share the value, so the divergent ideas are representative of everyone in some way, making  less stressful the discussion of the idea.\n\n The thing is that I can't find more bibliography to read about it... so I'm asking your opinion or recommended lectures that u could say.\n\nThanks!",

In social situations, I can be charming and funny around those I'm comfortable with, but this doesn't come out as much around strangers unless I'm drunk. At work I'm probably the funniest person there out of about 12 employees. I came to this conclusion by realizing I make people laugh the most out of everyone at work, but there's another guy there that has a good sense of humor too. Humor to me is a double edged sword, you can go for a joke and insult someone accidentally, or you can make them laugh hysterically. I seem to have a pretty good success rate even amongst women, which is good cause it means I don't have to resort to insult comedy, I just say dumb shit and people laugh.\n\nWhy am I posting this jumbled nonsense?\n\nI want some insight in how I could improve socially. I don't seem to be able to detect people's intentions particularly well, but I think the reason why I can function well socially is that I'm a good communicator, even if I don't say a lot amongst strangers. I suck at small talk a lot of the time cause I'm a bit of an odd ball and am not interested in a lot of what \"normal\" people are interested in. I'm a bit of an intellectual, in the sense that I love learning about shit, but I hate the idea of showing it off. Obviously I'm not that great at psych if you've seen my shit on here, but I think I have potential. I've only done one psych course at uni. I'm pretty good at maths, I just don't have good grades cause I used to be, and still sort of am, a bit of a delinquent/rebel.\n\nI haven't structured this cause I'm lazy, but if anyone can be bothered to read it and give me insight I'd really appreciate it. One of the reasons I think I have poor emotional intelligence is that I struggle to identify with and express my feelings well. I genuinely am starting to believe women are much more capable in this area. I think its an evolutionary trait. I think that's the right word :/\n\nAlso I seem to learn best through conversation.

Psychology Today is some sort of horrible muck-dredging, fact-crushing, tabloid monster that doesn't bother linking to the papers and journals it references, and constantly has bloggers posting bullshit that is not just suspect but flat out *wrong*.  Psychology Today rarely provides adequate context for the things they post.  The stuff they post doesn't even rise to the incredibly low bar of science journalism.\n\nIf you happen to see something you find interesting in Psychology Today, that's great, but be skeptical, and spend the time to dig up their sources.\n\nIf there are subjects you are interested, you are much better off reading Wikipedia on a subject, and then using Google Scholar to see if anything interesting has been posted that's freely available.",

      "title": "The Most Effective Method Discovered So Far to Boost the Human Brain: Fully Activate the Nervous System",
      "body": "High-speed oral reading engages the three sensory channels of vision, speech, and hearing to construct efficient circuits for information processing and output. This multi-channel and integrative training across different brain regions provides sustained high-intensity stimulation, reinforcing neural pathways and synaptic connections, thereby producing significant improvements in cognitive performance.\n\nHumans possess five senses—vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—but only vision and hearing can transmit information at high speed. Language, uniquely human and among the most complex brain functions, integrates these rapid input channels with abstract reasoning, logic, memory, and motor control. High-speed oral reading is therefore not just “seeing” and “hearing”: it also demands immediate output, transforming visual symbols into speech commands and coordinating fine motor movements for articulation.This closed-loop of input–processing–output activates multiple critical brain regions simultaneously, including the visual cortex, auditory cortex, language centers (Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas), and the motor cortex. By uniting the fastest sensory pathways with the most complex processing and output system, high-speed oral reading stands out as one of the most efficient methods for enhancing human cognition.\n\nThis kind of training works because it pushes the brain to remodel itself in three main ways:\n1.\t⁠Neuroplasticity – The brain adapts to new challenges by building and strengthening circuits. Reading aloud at double speed is such an intense stimulus that new connections form quickly. This is exactly why you can feel the speed increase in just a few days.\n2.\t⁠Myelination – Nerve fibers are wrapped in myelin, which acts like insulation on a wire. Repeated high-frequency activation may thicken this layer, making signals travel faster. This speeds up how quickly your brain processes information.\n3.\t⁠Connectivity – High-speed reading forces multiple brain areas (vision, hearing, language, movement) to fire together at high speed. The links between them get stronger, which improves coordination across the brain.\n\nTogether, these changes provide a biological explanation for why this practice can boost thinking speed, memory, and overall cognitive performance.\n\nMany English-learning apps use recordings from CNN or NPR, where anchors speak at a rapid pace. Reading aloud at twice that speed is like asking a runner to sprint at double pace—pushing practice close to the human limit.\n\nMany people noticed results within only a few days of practice. Yes, in just a few days you can feel your thinking speed noticeably accelerating.

The kind of depression where I cant find pleasure in things, hard to conjure up the energy to do basic tasks, negative emotions with which my logic would battle...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I started taking St Johns Wort (300mg 2-3x a day) about 2 and a half weeks ago and for the first time that I can remember, I feel amazing.  Clear headed, energetic.  I feel like Im happy again.  I had no expectations for it to work, I figured it was one of those \"if you're barely affected it'll help\" kinda herbs.  \r\n\r\nI have had some headaches as a side effect, although part of me wonders if thats more of a healing pain then a pain pain. (like exercising a damaged muscle/bone (healing pain) vs a bleeding open wound (pain pain))  Its an unusual headache.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you feel like you're suffering from a depression and are unable to afford doctors visits.  Try it, it works for non-severe cases. Im happy again, I can function again. St Johns Wort FTW!\r\n\r\nFORGOT TO MENTION EDIT: Also have been taking a multivitamin once a day on top of SJW\r\n\r\nEDIT EDIT: Research info: http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=502&cn=5\r\n\r\nNot a placebo\r\n\r\n\" The abstract gives the conclusion:\r\n\r\n\"Hypericum extracts were significantly superior to placebo... and similarly effective as standard antidepressants... There were two (0.8%) dropouts for side effects with hypericum and seven (3.0%) with standard antidepressant drugs. Side effects occurred in 50 (19.8%) of patients on hypericum and 84 (52.8%) of patients on standard antidepressants\".\r\n\r\n\"There is evidence that extracts of hypericum are more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to moderately severe depressive disorders.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThis seems like pretty strong evidence in favor of St. John's wort.\"",

      "body": "If you use these skills you'll connect with people on a deeper level than you're used to.\n\nYou'll learn to love talking with people, and people will love talking with you.\n\n**Skill #1 - A good listener doesn't listen to respond. They listen to learn.**\n\n\"Listening\" is not just \"hearing\". It's asking good questions that help you **understand** the other person.\n\nMy girlfriend told me *\"I don't like it when you tell me how to do things. I feel like you're judging me.\"*\n\n*\"I'm not judging you.\"* I said. *\"It was just a suggestion.\"*\n\n**I was not listening.**\n\nRegardless of how I experienced it, her experience was that I was judging her.\n\nA bad listener focuses on explaining his own experience.\n\nA good listener focuses on learning about the other person's experience:\n\n*\"Which part makes you feel like I'm judging you?\"*\n\n*\"Was it what I said, or how I said it?\"*\n\n*\"How would you like me to make suggestions in future? Or would you prefer it if I didn't make suggestions?\"*\n\nA good listener improves the way he relates with the other person by learning how they think. Learning what's important to them.\n\nA bad listener learns nothing.\n\nAt an interview for a sales job I was asked *\"How will you bring us 10 new clients in your first month?\"*\n\nI didn't have an answer prepared. I panicked and blurted out the usual ways of reaching new clients. It was an empty, generic answer.\n\n**I was not listening. Any monkey could've rattled off that list.**\n\nWhen the interviewer asked that question what he really wanted to know was: \"Does this guy know what he is doing?\"\n\nA good listener would've unpacked the interviewer's question and learned what the interviewer was looking for:\n\n*\"You know I haven't really thought about specific strategies. What's your biggest bottleneck right now in getting new clients on board?\"*\n\nA good listener aims to understand deeply.\n\nA bad listener misses the point.\n\n**Skill #2 - How to quickly find common interests (not the way you're thinking)**\n\nDon't get stuck in polite conversation. There's no \"skin\" invested in it. You've got to get at least a little bit naked (so to speak) in order to make friends with someone. Here's how you do it:\n\nWe humans have just 4­-8 basic emotions, depending on which study you read: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation. Everything we experience triggers a combination of these basic emotions. There aren’t that many combinations.\n\nWe may not have experienced the same activities, but we have experienced the same emotions. So when I say you need to find common interests, I mean you need to find something that sparks similar emotions ​in both of you.\n\nSay Felipe is studying to be an architect, and Manuela is studying to be a doctor. Felipe doesn’t care about medicine and Manuela doesn’t care about Architecture. They ask each other polite questions:\n\n*Felipe*: Oh I hear you have to study for a long time to be a Doctor. How many years do you have left?\n\n*Manuela*: Yeah, I’ve got another 2 years. 7 total. Although you never really stop learning. What do you want to design when you graduate?\n\n*Felipe*: Bridges. I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I’d be happy designing anything.\n\n*Manuela*: Yeah I know what you mean, I just want to graduate already as well!\n\nThis is pretty boring, right? Neither of them are offering or asking for emotional information. You need to make an effort to understand​ them. This chit­chat isn’t going to cut it.\n\nAt this level of conversation they have to keep thinking of new topics every few seconds. The ideas will dry up pretty soon. This is why conversations often feel like hard work. It’s much easier to pause and explore one topic for a while.\n\nSo here’s what you do...\n\n**You don’t just listen to respond. You listen to understand. You go deeper.**\n\n* Offer your own emotional information\n\n* AND dig for their emotional information.\n\nKeep digging until you understand their way of thinking. Until you feel the emotion they’re talking about. Then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own.\n\nThese questions are your friends:\n\n* WHAT do you like about that?\n\n* WHAT made you want that?\n\n* WHAT scares you about that?\n\n* Essentially any question that uncovers “What makes you feel that way?” or “What makes you think that way?”\n\nWHAT tends to work better than WHY because WHAT feels like you’re curious and WHY can sometimes feel like an attack. “WHY do you like that?\" “Because I do. What's your problem?!\"\n\nSo back to Felipe and Manuela. Now that they know how to “listen to understand”, how does their conversation go?\n\n*Felipe*: I mainly want to design bridges. But I guess I’d be happy designing anything.\n\n*Manuela*: What do you like about designing bridges specifically?\n\n*Felipe*: Well I haven't actually designed one yet, but for some reason I keep picturing myself standing on top of a huge bridge that I designed. I don’t know. It just makes me feel alive.\n\n*Manuela*: Yeah that sounds pretty cool. What do you mean by ‘alive’ though?\n\n*Felipe*: Hmm, well the bridge started as an idea in my head, and now I’m standing on it. It’s like having ultimate control over everything.\n\n*Manuela*: Oh I know that feeling! That’s how I feel when I think of saving someone’s life at the last minute in the emergency room. Boom… Doctor In­control.\n\n*Felipe*: Haha. Is that what made you decide to become a Doctor? Because you like feeling in­control?\n\n*Manuela*: Yeah, I guess it is.\n\n*Felipe*: Wow. That’s the same reason I decided to be an architect. So does that mean you hate it when other people boss you around too?\n\n*Manuela*: OMG that’s the worst!! I can’t stand it when other people tell me what to do.\n\nFun! Turns out they’re both control freaks. THAT’s their common interest. Now they can geek out on that instead of churning through countless emotionless topics that they don’t connect on.\n\n**Skill #3 - How to never run out of things to say**\n\nImagine you have a conversational D-pad. It gives you something to say whenever you run out of things to say. [These are the controls.](https://beardstrokings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dpad1.jpeg)\n\nSay you’re in a conversation about cars, and you don’t know anything about cars. You run out of things to say. What are your options? [Here's your conversational D-pad for cars](https://beardstrokings.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dpad2.png)\n\nSome people prefer to *zoom out*. They think and talk about general things: ideas and concepts.\n\nSome people prefer to *zoom in*. They think and talk about specific things: details and examples.\n\nYou’ve probably had conversations with people where you just don’t click with them. It could be because you prefer to zoom in and they prefer to zoom out, or vice versa.\n\n**Example**\n\n*Elena*: How was your day?\n\n*Pablo*: Good. Productive. I got a lot done. How was yours?\n\n*Elena*: Well! When I woke up I made toast, with butter and vegemite. I left it in the toaster a little too long and it got a bit burnt, but I scraped it off with a knife and it was fine. Then I cycled to work. I went down Oxford Street this time instead of my usual route down Henry Cotton Drive because I wanted a change.\n\nMy boss didn’t have anything for me to do today so I made an appointment to see the Doctor next Wednesday at 5pm and spent the rest of the day on Facebook chatting to Sofia about her baby, Ivan, who has a cold and Esteban about his new Porsche. Then I came home down Oxford Street again because it was so lovely in the morning. It wasn’t as nice in the evening. And now I’m talking to you.\n\n*Pablo*: So was your day good or not?\n\n*Elena*: I want to know what you did all day.\n\nPablo likes ideas and concepts (zoomed out). Elena likes details and examples (zoomed in).\n\nPablo is bored senseless by Elena’s details and Elena feels like Pablo doesn’t want to share things with her.\n\nPablo is interested in the big picture. He wants to understand the point of what Elena is telling him. What does it mean? Did she have a good day or a bad day?\n\nElena is interested in specifics. She wants to know what made Pablo’s day good or bad. What does he mean by ‘productive’? What did he get done?\n\nIf you find yourself in a conversation that just isn’t working you might be speaking to someone who has a different zoom preference. All you have to do to connect with them is zoom in or out to match their preference.\n\nIf they prefer to zoom in, give them details and examples. If they prefer to zoom out, give them the meaning behind your details and examples.\n\nIf you want more actionable advice like this, get your daily dose of communication hacks and people skills [here](https://beardstrokings.com/?utm_source=red-soceng3ski).",

Lower your tone at the end. It signals confidence and finality.\n3. Use fewer filler words \"Um,\" \"like,\" \"you know\" these kill your credibility. Pause instead. Silence shows you're thinking, not just filling space. Pauses make people pay attention. Because that way they understand you put effort into the words you say.\n4. Stop over-explaining \"I think we should do X\" hits harder than \"Well, I mean, maybe we could try X, but I don't know, what do you think?\" Say what you mean. Period. Don't make it long but keep it short.\n5. Match or mirror their volume If someone speaks softly, don't shout. If they're animated, bring energy. But always stay slightly calmer than them. You become the steady presence in the room.\n6. Use definitive language. Replace \"I feel like\" with \"I think.\" Replace \"maybe\" with \"likely.\" Replace \"I guess\" with \"I believe.\" Own your words. The kind of words you use dictate the image people have to you. As much as possible don't swear especially in professional settings.\n7. Don't fill every silence. Let your words breathe. When you finish making a point, stop talking. The urge to keep explaining shows insecurity. Plus the more you talk the more people will care.\n8. Speak to the person, not the group. Even in group settings, make eye contact with individuals. \"John, what's your take?\" vs \"What does everyone think?\" Direct connection creates respect. Because the more you talk to everyone the less chances anyone will respond.\n\nWhat I noticed when I started doing this:\n\nPeople stopped interrupting me mid-sentence. My ideas actually got heard and considered. Colleagues started asking for my opinion instead of talking around me.\n\nI realized I was apologizing for having thoughts. \"Sorry, but I think...\" or \"This might be dumb, but...\"\n\nStop apologizing for existing. Your ideas have value. Speak like you believe it.\n\nPractice this: Record yourself having a conversation (with permission). Listen back. Count the filler words, notice your tone, hear how you end sentences. It's eye-opening. Or just record yourself talking to yourself. It works either way.\n\nHow you speak is how people think of you think (Perception). If you sound uncertain, they assume you are uncertain. If you sound weak they will assume you are not trustworthy.\n\nYou don't need to be the loudest person in the room to command respect. You just need to sound like you respect yourself first.\n\nKeep learning. I had to learn this for years. Have a good day!\n\nIf you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/socialengineering_how_to_speak_so_that_people_respect_you_learned/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1).

      "title": "How to Run a Scam: My trip through China",
      "body": "Last week I went on a bus tour through Shanghai and Jiangsu province with my parents. We went from elaborate scam to elaborate scam and no one would believe me that they were scams. It was a social psychology clinic.\n\n\n**THE FORMAT**\n\nWe went to these middle-of-nowhere but well furnished facilities with equally well dressed salespeople (got to give the air of authenticity yo). The only other customers were tourists on similar tours. This is apparently not a red flag at all when I asked the other people about it.\n\n\nThis was followed by a pitch and upselling products around 3x their market price (in the case of raw goods like pearl, silk, tea) or 10x their market price (in the case of arts/crafts). In two cases I literally said, \"I've been to Thailand, silk is actually really cheap\" or \"Pearls can be farmed easily nowadays and dropped a ton in price since a few decades ago\" days before the pitches and people still bought things at these facilities.\n\n\nDespite my vocal anger that we had to listen to scams for 6 hours a day many of my fellow busgoers were still convinced that their $15,000 jade and $5,000 teapot were good deals. \n\nHere's what I learned from ~24 hours of listening to these pitches:\n\n\n**HOW TO RUN A SCAM**\n\n\n* **Propaganda Effect**\n\nEven before you get to the store, the tour guide is wearing whatever they're about to sell and tells you why the pearls/jade/silk/etc in the region is special or cheap. You go into the facilities and the guide there corroborates the same information. There are museum-like signs on the wall that say the exact same thing.\n\nIn the 30's a psychologist named Carl Hovland ran a study focusing on biased messages. \nHe found that when people receive new information they believe is biased they may be wary to believe it, but over time the memory of the source of the information fades and the wariness disappears, especially if it's corroborated by different sources over the same period of time.\nIt's actually how a lot of marketing fads work, you might not believe initially that gluten-free or juice detox works, but if you see enough information corroborating it, you will believe.\n\n\n* **You Guys are Smart, Aren't You?**\n\nSome presentations they show an obviously fake jade or pearl and ask what's wrong with it. When everyone answers \"it's fake\", the presenter acts impressed \"wow you guys are so smart\". Unfortunately she did not give us stickers to reward us for our intelligence.\n\nMy friend Sam once told me that he found the best way to get someone to like you is to pretend you think they're smart, which I strongly agree with but fail to do like 90% of the time because I guess I'm an asshole.\n\nThis technique also works really well here because it also reinforces the idea to these people that they are informed customers and can tell fakes when they see it, even though they have no fucking clue.\n\n\n* **Made Here**\n\nEvery location has either an actor posing as a master or student crafter working in the middle of the sales area or the tour area, the noisiest, busiest area of the facility because that makes sense.\n\nEveryone coming into these now believes the goods are made on the spot. Clearly they're not though; there's no kiln where they're making the teapots, there's no dyes where the silk is being spun. Also did I mention they're making the stuff in the middle of the fucking sales area?\n\nThis is usually combined with the presenter casually mentioning/reinforcing that handmade goods are worth more or talking about how long a piece took to make. Spoiler alert: it's never less than a year.\n\n\n* **Authority & Social Proof**\n\nThere is almost always an actor that the staff pretends to respect and honor. In turn, the customers respect and honor the actor as well. In several places there are cards that talk about the master crafters who have been there for 70+ years or went to college for \"tea\" who just so happen to be in that day (\"you guys are so lucky!\") so they can impart their wisdom to you. I would like to know if they are so wise and respected why they have to work in the middle of the tour route, you'd think they could at least have their own office right?\n\n\nOne location the staff even acted afraid of the master who was standoffish initially but \"noticed\" us on his way out and took an interest. Everyone laughed at his jokes and was quiet when he spoke.  I was told by the tourists that I should respect him when I started talking over his presentation and was later shunned by other busgoers for it.\n\n\nLater some girls my age told me they felt \"pressured\" by him and I think a large part of it was because they believed they should respect/fear him like the staff did. They bought matching $500 jades. I later told the same girls that we could use the same technique to help me pick up girls (if they pretended to have the time of their lives with me at the club) and they told me \"that wouldn't work on us\"\n\n\n* **Liking Bias**\n\nI keep going back to this \"master\" but that pitch was by far the best. Studies show that for you to like someone initially the three biggest factors are: 1) They are attractive 2) They are like you 3) They like you\n\nI think the last one is the most important and that's the one a salesman has the most control over. \n\nThe \"master\" took a \"genuine\" interest to us after being standoffish, asking us about where we were from and taking his \"valuable\" time to especially focus on the most important clients. I think that actor was most successful because he made us feel liked by someone who was \"important\". \n\nI mean, I didn't feel liked though. They actually wouldn't let me into the master's private office after I asked him if he could calligraph \"scam\" in Chinese so fuck that guy.\n\n\n* **Teacher is Always Right**\n\nThe presenters almost always tells true things when presenting. They teach interesting new things like how silk is made, how jade is mined or carved, or how pearls are farmed.\nThey tell you how to value pearls or jade by size, color, etc. so you feel like you're informed. They also give a demonstration that wows people: Real silk never burns. Green tea can clear red iodine (or some chemical that they use) from water whereas water cannot.\nReal jade scratches glass without scratching itself. Some of these are actually pretty cool.\n\nEven if you already know this, this further extends your trust in them. Because what they teach you is true, it's assumed that everything is true.\n\n\n* **Reciprocity**\n\nThis is a small one, but we always got free tea, free gifts, etc. In the case of the previously stated \"master\" they got free palm readings.\n\nPeople have an extreme discomfort when they feel like they \"owe\" someone something.\n\nMarketers know this technique and do a soft version of it by giving free samples, but salesmen master it by giving a legitimately expensive gifts to high net-worth individuals. There's a trick where if you get a P.O. Box in an expensive zip code ($>1M average income) you can get free nights at hotels or free first class flights. These only exist in New York and California; I checked.\n\nWhile this subversion generally doesn't work nowadays, this is why guys learn to buy drinks for their intended targets at a bar.\n\n\n* **Chi, Detoxing, & other Bullshit**\n\nThey threw these in for good measure: Jade apparently centers your chi, green tea can reduce the toxins in your body, etc. These are marketing/pseudoscience scams that you are likely to believe if you are their target market.\n\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\n\nThe most straight up amazing thing to me is that these people clearly had no interest in these products before because they clearly don't know how they're priced. After watching a short presentation they're suddenly inclined to blow hundreds or thousands of dollars on these objects. I think we cleared $30k on this trip between the 12 of us (I know because every purchase over $5k was followed by a round of applause which I actually find hilarious).\n\n\nI wanted to ask a few questions to these buyers like:\n\n* If these guys are master crafters whose work are worth thousands, and these are collectors items, why are they only selling to tourists in remote facilities?\n* How do you think they can afford to run these massive businesses if they are giving us a good deal on these products and their only customers are tourists?\n* Why are they building shit in the middle of the sales area?\n* If you agree that there is a chance this is a scam, why would you consider buying anything at all?\n* If this bus tour was a scam, what would they be doing differently than what they are doing now that would make you believe it's a scam?\n\n**Cognitive Dissonance**\n\n\nThe most infuriating thing to me was that when I told some people they were being scammed they were angry with me. In fact I think in some cases it made them want to purchase more. After a somewhat heated exchange with one of the girls my age, she made the regretful $500 purchase.\n\nWe saw 6 hours of presentations a day. I think for a lot of people they would rather believe they weren't scammed and spend hundreds more than believe they wasted their vacations. When some of them came to the light, they were also furious, whereas most of the others said they enjoyed their trip.\n\nFor the captive audience I think it was more fun to believe that it wasn't a scam and consider purchasing something rather than be like me.\n\nAlso, I think it's a blow to the ego to realize you've been scammed. I think most people would describe themselves as \"street smart\" since it's a way to feel smart that's ambiguous/hard-to-test and being scammed definitely wrecks that image.\n\n**Post Purchase Rationalization**\n\n\nNot really part of the scam, but after my mother purchased her 3x overpriced pearls (she actually did not believe me until she was told it was a scam by the bank when withdrawing money to pay).\nShe justified it as donating to the local economy. The girl who spent $500 on the jade is convinced it's still worth $500, she just doesn't know why she bought a $500 jade. \nFor some of the art pieces it was justified that they would \"appreciate in value\". I notice myself doing this sometimes too after making a poor choice or purchase and I think it's very natural for most people to do this.",

      "title": "Reading \"How To Win Friends and Influence People\" is literally a cheat code.",
      "body": "For five years, I had chronic social anxiety and that changed when I owned \"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\" I’d read it, highlighted passages but actually not put it to work.\n\nThen the pain of my having bad social skills got bad enough. The isolation started to feel less like a choice and more like a prison. That's when I re-opened the book and started applying the principles for real this time.\n\nI went from being ignored to people asking advice for me now.\n\nHere’s the raw, unfiltered breakdown of the techniques I stole from Carnegie that actually changed everything:\n\n* I started using names a lot. It felt unnatural, almost manipulative at first. Instead of a generic \"thanks,\" it became \"Thanks, Sarah.\" Instead of \"good point,\" it was \"That's a sharp insight, Mike.\" I expected people to find it weird. Instead, they lit up. Their entire demeanor changed. You can see a flicker of recognition in their eyes, a small spark that says, \"You see me.\"\n* forced myself to become interested. I used to fake interest in other people's lives. It was exhausting and transparent. But instead of letting that past I decided to find somethin we can connect to. This was especially great when I realized my other co-worker also liked to draw. We became friends instantly when I knew he can also paint.\n* I forced myself to be humble. My old self was desperate to prove my intelligence. I’d correct people, one-up their stories, and offer unsolicited \"better\" ways of doing things. It was pure insecurity. I switched tactics. Now, when someone explains something, I ask, \"How did you even think of that?\" or \"What was your process for figuring that out?\" People hate being corrected.\n* stopped pointing out mistakes. A coworker screws up in a meeting. The old me might have pointed it out to look sharp but now \"I think those numbers might be from last quarter, we should double-check,\" or \"I might be misremembering, but I thought we agreed on X.\" It gives them an out. They get to fix the mistake without being publicly humiliated. They never forget who had their back in a moment of weakness. It helps a lot.\n* Instead of thinking what to say, I listened. I used to treat conversations like a debate. While the other person was talking, I'd think of what to say next. It was exhausting because I was performing a constant mental juggling act. I forced myself to stop. To just shut up and absorb what the other person was *actually saying*. To ask questions about *their* points. Suddenly, conversations weren't work anymore. When you stop trying to steer, you can actually enjoy the ride.\n* I celebrated people's wins. When a coworker did something well, I’d mention it to others, especially to people in charge. \"Did you see how Sarah handled that client? It was brilliant.\" It costs you nothing. Zero effort. But the person you celebrated will see you as an ally for life. People never forgive those who gossip about them but never forget those who praise them behind their backs.\n\nI hope this was helpful. This is what I use a lot even now. If you have questions feel free to ask.\n\nIf you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/socialengineering_reading_how_to_win_friends_and_influence_people/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/habits_how_to_speak_so_that_people_respect_you_learned/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1).

      "title": "I decided to be a hot chick on the messaging app Kik, this is what I discovered!",
      "body": "As you've probably gleaned from the title, I spent the day pretending to be a hot chick on the messaging app Kik. Obvious question, why? I don't know really. You only ever know what you experience and I guess I was curious. I lurk this sub a lot and I honestly thought \"where do people find these weirdos\". After this experiment, the answer turned out to be a very generic \"online\". So, let's crack on with what I learned.\n\n**Guys love their dicks and ~~want~~ need you to look at them**\n\nI knew going into it that I was going to get bombarded by various penises from around the globe but the [sheer](http://i.imgur.com/AoBHB7K.png) [scale](http://i.imgur.com/SnBOyXj.png) was [impressive](http://i.imgur.com/NsRnxbs.png). Those are just the ones I wanted to screenshot, literally every word of this paragraph could be linked to a different guy. One guy was kind enough to even send me three. All of them different dicks. I think the reason behind the dick pic is that in their mind, if a girl was to send a picture of her vagina to a random guy, he'd love it, so why not return the favour?\n\n**You can get away with anything if you're hot**\n\nI do mean anything. [(1)](http://i.imgur.com/x6GfaAX.png)[(2)](http://i.imgur.com/cqfXukK.png)[(3)](http://i.imgur.com/XUN4W9U.png) Obviously those don't reflect my opinions, I just started seeing how far I could go. I spoke to him for ages and he clearly wasn't a racist, Islamophobe or anti-Semite, he just pretended to be to talk to me. Honestly, he wasn't the only one. I pretended to be incredibly stupid, a conspiracy nut and someone with genuine psychological problems. They didn't really take in anything I was saying, I was talking at them and they were just nodding in the hope that if you agree with enough of my idiotic ideas, you get rewarded with naked pictures.\n\n**I was finally popular and it was fun to start with**\n\nI posted my username on [Kikfriends](http://www.kikfriends.com), stated that I was female, looking for men or women and looking for someone to talk to. I didn't have to wait long. Immediately, my phone was blowing up with more people eager to talk to me than I could respond to. I'd say that in my one day (well, about 12 hours) I got more than 300 messages. The stats on Kikfriends says that I have 848 views at time of writing. \n\nNow, I'm a middle of the road kind of guy. I'm not amazingly attractive, pretty introvert and have only ever handled a small group of friends. I wasn't popular in school, nor was I bottom row. But today has taught me what being popular means and, honestly, it rocked. I felt like everybody wanted to hang out with me, that saying they knew me was some sort of achievement. I had never had that before and got sucked in but then you realise why they're nice to you and it sorta breaks the magic. I went from \"look at me, come talk to me\" to wanting to be avoided. I knew that every person that messaged me had one purpose and it was soul destroying. I was no longer a person. It's hard to explain but given the content on this sub, I'm sure you're all familiar with it.\n\n**You learn to hate pet names VERY QUICKLY**\n\nI've never been one to call my girlfriend hun, babes or puddleduck or whatever. It just doesn't sit right on my tongue. It's like when teachers try to be cool, it's just so obviously forced. I never had a problem with pet names is what I'm saying, I just didn't use them. Now though, I fucking abhor them. I used a name in my profile so that I was easier to talk to. Monica is what I went with. The amount of times I was \"sexy\", \"beautiful\", \"babe\", \"hun\" or my personal worst \"bb\" (YOU'RE MISSING OUT TWO LETTERS, IT'S NOT MUCH QUICKER) is beyond count. It really started to annoy me more than it should've. What pet names like \"beautiful\" and \"sexy\" represent to me now are just words that show the guys intentions, that you're not a person, you're a body he wants to do sex on. A vessel for his seed. Literally that's all. That's by no means ground breaking but it's a recurring theme.\n\n**You get mean out of necessity**\n\nI'm not an angry person. I'm not a mean person. I can't hurt peoples feelings. Today was different. [(1)](http://i.imgur.com/yex3HZi.png)[(2)](http://i.imgur.com/nnQTk9V.png) Now those may not seem very mean to you but I've never been that directly horrible to a person before this and it really made me feel bad. But believe it or not, it was the only way to get him to stop talking to me. Without background, I seem out of the blue mean but what you're missing is that he said it was my fault that guys were sending me dick pics (more on that in a second) and was being very chauvinistic. I told him I don't want to talk to him because we have differing opinions but he kept coming back asking me if I've ever been with a girl and if they're \"more tender\" than guys and asking my bra size and if I've done anal. I'd say \"please stop talking to me\", he'd stop for five minutes then chime in with \"whats the biggest dick you've been with?\". Where the picture start is him not talking to me for probably going on 30 minutes then out of the blue he starts telling me that his dad is annoying him or something. It was just getting too much. I'd hate to have to be mean for more than this experiment.\n\n**It's my fault that guys treat me the way they do (and it's what I want)** \n(I hear that Trigger Warnings are essential, so I do use the word rape here, if that upsets you, the TL;DR is I was blamed for the amount of guys not treating me as a human being because the picture I used had cleavage, feel free to skip)\n\nI started this to prove to myself that it's not as bad as it seems. I was wrong. I honestly wanted to talk to people and hoped that my being female was a small formality. I was not looking for dick pics and guys calling me a slut to screencap them and say \"ha, guys are dicks\". The picture I chose was what I would consider attractive, there was admittedly a bit of cleavage but not a lot and it was not the focus of the picture. It just happened to be there. So when I get shit like [this](http://i.imgur.com/l7MPg6R.png), it fucking annoyed me. He meant attention I think. Over and over I'd get guys opening with \"I'm sorry\", I'd ask \"why?\", then be told that guys will be sending me pictures because my tits are out. Fuck off. Also, does this mean that if cleavage is present guys are unable to treat women as human being? 'Cause that's what I learned today. It was my fault. Heck, the girl in the picture I used has probably been raped five ways to Friday on the day that she wore that top.\n\n**You meet guys to talk to but it's hard to escape the fact that they want to see you naked**\n\nI met a few guys that I got talking to, had some pretty fun conversations it was great. Then this would happen. [(1)](http://i.imgur.com/AXAICqH.png)[(2)](http://i.imgur.com/zagnAeb.png)[(3)](http://i.imgur.com/gV5dQJe.png) It sucked. It sucked hard. I don't actually have any words for it. I discovered the other side of the \"friend zone\". I was the girl with the guy friend who wanted to date her and *boo hoo, the guy really wants to date the girl but she's just interested in being friends and it's such a shame for the guy*. Fuck the guy, fuck the guy in his asshole. I wasn't flirty. I was me, just under the guise of being female. I talked about the football team I supported (come on you Barca), the games I liked, the shows I watched. I wasn't winking going \"will you be the Jamie to my Cercei, giggle\" but the topic of sex always came up and it was always unavoidable. I'd dismiss it like I hadn't heard him and continue as normal, as would he. Then it'd come back again and again. Once you firmly establish that you won't be talking about sex or sending them naked pictures, they get bored and most of the time [will let you know.](http://i.imgur.com/3nIuAGT.png)\n\n**Guys have a fantasy and you don't have a choice whether to play along or not**\n\nI was pretending to be a new mother in search of a \"baby daddy\". I was poorly educated, racist and a cheat. The first time I tried that act, the guy bit. He said he'd look after me, send me money, the whole shebang. Then he started calling me a slut, a whore, sending me picture of his dick telling me that \"You love that you filthy slut\". To this point, nothing I said could've led him to think humiliation was a turn on for me. At all. Nothing. I dropped the act and asked what the fuck he was doing. His reply was \"I thought you wanted it\". It was obvious that this was his fetish and I had to play along. He wasn't even the only one. I had an encounter with a guy that wanted me to pretend he was tiny and I was to squish him? I don't know what he wanted. I'm not ridiculing that fetish, if that's what gets you off, great but I don't know anything about it. Anyway, the point was that these were forced upon me and they didn't care about it from my perspective. It goes along with the recurring theme that I'm not human to them. I'm a picture on their phone that could be a really well designed game. Say things in the correct order and you win!\n\n**Guys pretend to be girls(HOW COULD THEY)**\n\nWhat I mean is that countless times a woman would message me and eventually try to get picture of me. \"Could've been a lesbian\" I hear you say? Wrong. It was so very obvious that the pictures they were sending were something they ripped from 4chan or something. Anytime they'd tell me they were taking a picture for me, it'd come from their gallery. (I wasn't asking for pictures, they were insisting that if they send me something, I should send them something) Oceans Eleven-esque deception it was not. I think they genuinely believe women are all naked around each other for any amount of time. That locker rooms are like that one scene in Not Another Teen Movie, that it's a given that a girl has had a lesbian experience. It's mind numbing that they think women are so far detached from them that don't do things they do.\n\n**I gave a guy exactly what he wanted and it made me feel bad**\n\nNow, the picture of the girl I was using also came with a naked picture of her. She's a fairly obscure [Page 3 Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_3) so don't feel bad that her naked picture is now out there. It was already out there. So yeah. A guy messages me with a picture of his dick and I decide to see what the end result of this is. I sent a couple other pictures (with clothing) and he obliged with more nudity, so I then dropped the naked pic on him. After what I think was him ejaculating (I'm straight but dedicated to this) we talked. We talked about where he was from, his plans for the future etc etc. Really deep shit that I think counts as pillow talk? After a long time, he started telling me that he loved me. I thought the same thing you're thinking right now, \"guys will say anything to get what they want\". So I said that to him. He then started to tell me that he's never had a girlfriend, he's really lonely and I was the first person to show interest in him and that he might not know what love feels like, but that he was feeling something. I don't know why it got to me but it crushed me. Every time I seen a dick pic I could only see this guy behind it, someone who doesn't know how to connect with women, who is lonely and someone who is otherwise a good person. I'm not sticking up for the guys who throw dicks into ~~your~~our face. I'm really not. They're wrong and need to be told so. But they're not out the be horrible, they honestly think that it's what you want, deluded as they may be. They think it'll make you like them. And that depresses me. These people won't have much luck with potential relationships and they won't know enough to know that it's their fault. They'll blame women and well, that's how /r/TheRedPill/ happened.\n\n\n[I'll end on a happy note. This is a serious profile picture that a guy had (censor is mine) and it makes me giggle.](http://i.imgur.com/xFmAr2F.png)\n\nI need to go look at some puppies or something now.\n\n**I'm being flooded right now and may take some time to reply but I'll try to reply to as many people as I can**",

Now lately during the week it's been chaotic, the line to get into the office on the other side is horrible.  Last week I decided to see if they left the door open on the side of the building I need to drop and pickup at.\n\n  Mind you I'm not doing anything besides walking in to the other side, getting my paperwork and walking out.  So I'm doing nothing nefarious.  However seeing that they leave the door open left me with this idea.\n\n I can't take credit for it but I truly wanted to see if it worked so I can cut down on my time spent here.  So I put on the safety vest, and grab my clipboard.  At first employees just looked and moved on... every employee just ignored me... that day I had to pass back and forth 4 times... (dumb reasons but whatever)\n\n\nSo earlier today I tried it again... again I kept getting looked at.  Not one word said to me.  Grabbed my paperwork and walked back.  This time I had an employee talking to me.  Literally asking me if I was just getting there to clock in. 😏\n\nIn truth I was honest with him and he didn't care, but at first he was thrown off thinking I was an employee.  The fact that it worked that well was insane to me, how many people just don't recognize who works there and who doesn't, and doesn't think about the security.\n\nNow again I wasn't there to do any harm and I just wanted a short cut to get in and get out... but I thought I'd share the story on how effective that knowledge is...\n\nEdited: to improve quality of read.",

      "body": "I used to be the guy everyone walked over. At work, in relationships, even with strangers which made me felt invisible.\n\nThen I discovered these psychology tricks that completely flipped how people treat me. Now people actually listen when I speak.\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\n1. Stop over-explaining yourself. The more you justify your decisions, the weaker you sound. Say \"I can't make it Friday\" instead of \"I can't make it Friday because my cousin's dog has a vet appointment and...\" which sounds bad like you're running away from it.\n2. Use the 2-second pause before responding to anything, count to two. It shows you're thoughtful, not reactive. Plus, it makes people hang on your words. Silence makes people perceive your words as credible.\n3. Match their energy, then dial it down 10% If someone's excited, be interested but stay slightly calmer. If they're angry, be concerned but composed. You become the stable one they look up to. Most people are emotional so if they see you are not they will respect you.\n4. Ask \"What do you think?\" instead of giving advice firs. People respect those who value their opinions even when you know the answer, let them feel heard first.\n5. Stand up straight, but relax your shoulders. Confidence is shown when your taking up your space comfortably. This one changed how people see me instantly.\n6. Remember small details about people like \"How did your presentation go last week?\" These little callbacks show you actually pay attention. It's rare, and people notice when you mention things that are easy to forget.\n7. Say \"I don't know\" when you don't know. Pretending to have all the answers makes you look insecure. Admitting ignorance? That takes real confidence. Being honest about your knowledge makes you genuine.\n\nRespect isn't about being the loudest or smartest person in the room. It's about being genuine, thoughtful, and secure enough to let others shine too.\n\nTry just ONE of these this week. You'll be shocked at how differently people respond to you.\n\nIf you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/darkpsychology_7_psychology_secrets_that_make_people_instantly/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/habits_how_to_speak_so_that_people_respect_you_learned/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1).

      "title": "15 Shades of Russian Propaganda. An Extensive Guide to Russian Social Engineering Techniques and How To Counter Them.",
      "body": "There was a vital invention that has saved tens of millions of human lives throughout history — soap and hygiene. The simple ritual of washing hands stopped the spreading of deadly diseases and allowed humankind to make a gigantic leap. To survive now, we need to introduce to our everyday life another crucial ritual — “washing our thoughts”, that helps us to see and dispose of thoughts propaganda tries to implement. We could see another age of dictatorships and wars if we don’t.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a16ystxns5ea1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac4205e9440c3553b66615d02de20aab46bd21b\n\nHow to do it? There is a trick in countering propaganda: if you can name and understand how a technique is intended to influence your mind, it will not work on you. And we live in the “blissed” times when almost a whole country provides the world with tons of selected propaganda. Let’s examine Russian propaganda’s methods and how to avoid getting on its hook.\n\n#### 1) “Rotten Fish”\n\nIf you repeat something disgusting about someone, whether true or not, it “sticks” to that person/country. A good example is a statement regarding nazi/nationalistic groups in Ukraine. Russia doesn’t aim to prove this; it only wants that there was a discussion, defenders and attackers for this thesis. As a result, if the person stands near a rotten fish for too long, the smell sticks to them, and the person becomes unconsciously associated with the idea.\n\nI am amazed at how it works because it is complete bullshit for me, and I would never think somebody would believe it. I have lived in different parts of Ukraine: Eastern, Western, and Central, but I have never seen at least half of a nazi in person. However, I met people from Germany, Serbia, and other countries that believed it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1aryd92qs5ea1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed45b21786ffef59453e144e6b8c6a7d3736c415\n\n#### 2) “60/40”\n\n60% of truth and 40% of lies. Create a media that deliver truthful information, but after establishing trust and the audience, starts to incept propagandistic messages. In WWII, Goebbels created an “anti-nazi” radio station that successfully existed and served nazis until the war’s end. Only after the audience found out it was nazi propaganda. Channel “Russia Today” could be an excellent example of leveraging such a principle.\n\n#### 3) “Creation of a dragon”\n\nA common enemy unites a group and can be blamed for any calamities the group suffers. Finding an absolute enemy is sewn into our unconsciousness with hundreds of fairytales about knights, dragons, Saurons, etc. Russia leverages it by making USA and NATO the dragon. In Ukraine, we mock it like: “Oh, that was Biden and Zelensky who corrupted the Russian government, littered on the streets, and turned so many people into alcoholics”.\n\nWhy does this technique work? Usually, it works on people that don’t take responsibility for their lives and are used to blaming others. It’s always easier to accuse someone than work hard on improving one’s life. Another factor — is a lack of critical thinking. If people are told by TV that Russia’s adversaries are because of the USA/masons/Jews, bothering with analysis of the actual cause-and-effect relationships of this thesis could result in catastrophic consequences — the need to make independent actions and choices, which is extremely scary! So, it’s better to have a dragon. \n\n#### 4) “Creation of a saviour”\n\nIf you have a dragon, you need a prince or “the saviour” who will “protec, attac and provide snacks”. By creating a strong image (only image), Putin leverages this method to get the loyalty of not only Russians but also people abroad.\n\nThe mechanism of this technique is the same: if a person doesn’t want to work hard and transform their life, they or will start looking for the saviour who could do it for them. The whole USSR ideological machine had successfully leveraged this method for 90 years, and you could find a lot of other entities that use it. The thing is that “salvation” always stays on the mythological level — the promise of the Lost Paradise is never fulfilled.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqr1mn6us5ea1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6677f33848435e466828be8690093569f325991a\n\n#### 5) “A very big lie”\n\nConfidently stating something so unlogical and blatant that a person willy-nilly starts to believe it — people refuse to believe that anyone can lie so shamelessly. A good example is Russia’s statement that USA and Ukraine are developing biologically modified birds for spreading diseases in Russia. The crucified child in Donbas goes to that pool also.\n\n#### 6) “Power Signalling”\n\nSimilar to the big lie, but perceives another aim and audience. Stating some complete rubbish always sends a signal like “I can do whatever I want, and you can change nothing”. The goal of such informational overload with fiction stories about biolabs, children’s crucifixions and nazis are to subconsciously persuade intelligent people in Russia that they can’t change anything. As someone said: “The true goal of propaganda is not to persuade you but to make you do nothing”.\n\nThe power signalling also works for an external audience: “see how much control I have over my population! I can feed them lies that are obvious for the whole world to see!”\n\n### 7) Their Majesty “Whataboutism”\n\nMy favourite one. It aims to redirect the attention from accusing to self-justification. For example, if somebody mentions Bucha or Mariupol massacres, a Russian can counter it with smth like: “And what has the USA done to Iraq?”. So, two things happen. Somebody others sin is used to justify their own, which it doesn’t. And the attention is driven from the central thesis to another country and other times.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l226n6qvs5ea1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c752b2b8e3d6d0bc46a92e7022e1699a4a9959\n\n“Moral Equivalence” is one of the whatoubatism variations. Popular with Nazi apologists and holocaust deniers. The argument is that X is bad, BUT everyone does it. For example, soldiers in every army have killed POWs and civilians and committed rape, so why pick on the poor Russians?\n\n#### 8) Brandolini’s law (Bullshit symmetry principle)\n\nIt is an internet adage that emphasises the effort of debunking misinformation compared to the relative ease of creating it in the first place. It states, “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.” Russians leverage it by creating many crazy narratives: biolabs, nazi, Ukrainians bombing Donbas, Poland wanting to conquer the west of Ukraine, Ukraine wanting to attack Russia… You see, you could get a bit tired just by reading this sentence.\n\nThanks a redditer u/Ok-Yogurtcloset-6740  for providing info on this technique.\n\nAnother example by u/LuukR on how Russians tried to shift responsibility for the MH17 catastrophe. First, they claimed that Ukrainian jets shut down MH17 even though those jets couldn’t reach that altitude (they edited Wikipedia to support their claim). Then Ukrainian SAMs supposedly shut down MH17 even though it was clearly proven that it was a specific BUK rocket that only Russia possessed. And finally, the CIA put a bomb inside the plane because… it is always the CIA.\n\nOften Brandolini’s law is paired with the Gish Gallup, whose goal is to overwhelm an opponent with a stream of true or false arguments to put out so many your opponent can’t refute everything. Thanks, u/FlatBlueSky for explaining that.\n\n#### 9) “The firehose of falsehood”\n\nIt is similar to Brandolini’s law. Basically throwing bullshit at the wall in the hope that some of it will stick, with no regard for verifiability, realism, or % of the truth, just massed claims pulled out of a vatnik’s ass. If you try to combat it, by the time you debunk one lie, 20 more will take its place, so the only feasible option is to tune it out entirely, at which point vatniks complain that they wanted an honest discussion, but you don’t.\n\nThe goal isn’t to build any self-consistent false narrative because it’s hard to get enough consistency. Instead, the goal is to throw out such a massive number of narratives that the truth gets buried. Then everyone latches onto the narrative that has the most emotional appeal to them personally.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m2ugidxs5ea1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=df60a35551adb1e8c267c375899cd996979d8a7d\n\nThanks for that u/KlaatuBaradaN-word. Scientific research that reinforces this technique is that lies spread faster than truth: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap9559](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap9559) \n\n#### 10) “Divide and Conquer”\n\nOld as the world, seeding distrust and dislike between allies by, e.g. posing as one while overzealously criticising another. Thanks, u/einalex for highlighting this one.\n\nI.e., Russia accused Poland of preparing to invade the west of Ukraine. Creating many videos on Europe that “is freezing without Russia” to undermine Europe’s support of democracy.\n\n#### 11) “Strong and weak enemy”\n\nAnother widespread one, fascists used this a lot: The enemy is both weak and strong simultaneously. So, it is OK to insult and call them derogatory names; they are nothing compared to their own country/race. But at the same time, these ‘weak’ others also threaten our culture/country/safety.\n\nUsing this, Russia can display Ukraine as a state that shouldn’t be there/is just little Russia AND as a den of lethal neo-nazi wanting to eat Russian babies. They can adjust the frame/argument according to what is needed at that particular moment.\n\nThanks, u/LLLLLdLLL, for providing thoughts on that.\n\n#### 12) Radicalisation\n\nMuch propaganda is built on a kernel of truth. That makes people more likely to believe the rest of the message alongside the truth. “X is not perfect — we can prove this — therefore, X is the worst possible thing and is the enemy.” You see this in purposeful propaganda efforts and even in ordinary people posting on social media. “This group didn’t do exactly what I think they should, so let’s hate everything about them!!! We must oppose them!”\n\nCredits to u/ChairsAndFlaff for providing information on that.\n\nExample: Russia has conducted an excellent campaign using this technique in Germany. They published many articles on Ukrainian “nationalism” and “antisemitism” in influential German media during 2014–15. The topic was about a political party, “Svoboda”, some members of which made few antisemitic statements, and Russia started to trumpet “nazis in Ukraine”.\n\nThe truth is those were very few members of that party, which itself got only around 5% of the seats in our parliament. The party members didn’t have a lot of support and were mostly perceived as chatterboxes and populists. As a result, they didn’t get any seats during our next elections.\n\n#### 13) “Truth Relativism”\n\nIt is impossible to prove anything with absolute certainty, so nothing can be proved. For instance, Oryx must be wrong because the figures cannot be verified completely. This type of argument is popular with Covid deniers, flat earthers and those who think the moon landing was faked. There are degrees of wrongness, so we can discuss degrees of truth.\n\nRussia leverages it in narratives like “you can’t stay with confidence that wasn’t Ukrainians in Bucha / it wasn’t staged” and so on. Even some pretty direct evidence, like satellite images, still can be “relevant” from the point of view of the Russian propagandists.\n\n#### 14) “Victimhood”\n\nThis changes the narrative to make the people of Russia seem to be the real victims. “It’s Russian people suffering the most because they “have to” follow their dictator”. Though, it’s not Putin who kills civilians, shells energy infrastructure and posts requests to destroy Ukrainians on local Russian social media.\n\nFor the previous two, and “moral equivalence, I thank u/One_Cream_6888\n\n**15) “Sealioning”**\n\nA subtle form of trolling involving “bad-faith” questions. You disingenuously frame your conversation as a sincere request to be enlightened, placing the burden of educating you entirely on the other party.\n\nIf your bait is successful, the other party may engage, painstakingly laying out their logic and evidence in the false hope of helping someone learn.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrshrszys5ea1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=64c15b843f79bbdf4ff308cb6681da22794e7c33\n\nIn fact, you are attempting to harass or waste the other party’s time and have no intention of truly entertaining their point of view. Instead, you react to each piece of information by misinterpreting it or requesting further clarification ad nauseum.\n\nRussian trolls use this technique as a hook for engaging and starting to promote their narratives. Credits to u/briefnuts for this technique.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPropaganda is fuel for dictatorship regimes. Understanding and educating others about it undermines dictatorships and prevents their spread. Analysing and processing all the data we consume nowadays is as important as washing our hands. Stopping “ideological bacteria” from spreading, we give the whole of humanity to survive the dictatorship pandemic and take a step toward a peaceful future and coexistence. That’s why education and critical thinking will play a critical role in our survival.\n\nThank you for reading!

      "title": "Hello /r/socialengineering, I posted this originally in /r/confession, but they felt it would fit in better here. WARNING: Wall of text, but worth the read!",
      "body": "When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was \"From Hell\" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account… all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of \"stealing is wrong\" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this:\n\n* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.\n3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting.\n* During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.\n* Once completed I would do a \"fake transaction\" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.\n* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my \"bag\" at a later time.\n\nThis operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.\n\nAt the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking \"problem solver\" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. \n\nBecause Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared \"Cash or credit\", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.\n\nMy General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. \n\nSo this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked.  I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.\n\nI had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. \n\nYou're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.\n\nEven before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to \"crack.\" One of the most commonly used techniques is the \"Loaded Question Tactic.\" I will attempt to explain:\n\nA loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda.\n\nExample:\n\nThe question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded.\n\nSince this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers:\n\t1. \"Yes, I have stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I was beating my wife.\"\n\t2. \"No, I haven't stopped beating my wife\", which entails \"I am still beating my wife.\"\n\t\nThe proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say \"I have never beaten my wife.\" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me.\n\nOctober 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. \n\nAt the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report… he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get \"yelled at and it would blow over.\" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said \"No.\" But it wasn't a suspicious \"no.\" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.\n\n[Continued here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/15mwsb/hello_rsocialengineering_i_posted_this_originally/c7nw6u7)",

      "body": "I've had lots of great jobs and I have no college degree and am not particularly skilled in my field. I'm great at thinking on my feet and talking to people, but that's not an asset until I get an interview.  These are the tactics I've used to get dozens of interviews over the last 5 years in competitive fields, mostly for jobs with a listed degree requirement.      \n*Note that these guidelines are for crafting a custom resume for a specific position.  If you are trying to send the same resume to several companies or upload it into a database all of this doesn't necessarily apply. \n\n\nGoal: To convince a manager that you are a worthwhile interview candidate in less than 10 seconds with a Resume and Cover Letter. Of course obvious advice such as not having spelling or formatting mistakes is important, but these strategies can help you stand out of a pile of well-written resumes.     \n1) Cover Letter (First-person)   \n1a) First Sentence - The first sentence should be a snappy overview of what you do, your experience, and the assertion that you are excited about the position.    \nE.g. \"I am a front end web developer with more than 8 years of experience and I'd love to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your growing engineering team.\"     \n1b) Address the cover letter to the hiring manager.  This info should be easy to find online or with a phone call.       \n1c) Body of cover letter - Go beyond the company's website and find out what the company's long term goals  and challenges are.  Address how you would use your skills to help the goals be met and the challenges overcome.      \n1d) Tone -  Match the tone to the organization.  A goofy yet smart cover letter might get your foot in the door at a startup, but a formal letter would be more appropriate for a bank.  Looking at how their web copy is written is a good indicator of this.     \n2) Resume  (3rd-person)      \n2a) Objective - You must mention both a benefit to you and to the company as concisely as possible.  Don't just say you want a position at X doing X.    \nE.g. Objective: To obtain a position in data entry where skills in spreadsheet development and troubleshooting can improve efficiency and enhance value.    \n2b) Key accomplishments and attributes - Not more than 3, maybe 4 bullet points.  These are your selling points, make sure they are punchy and desirable.     \n2c) The rest - Make sure it fits on one page and all relates to the position you are gunning for.  Don't include \"will furnish references upon request\" or any other unnecessary clutter.   Include multiple forms of contact information.  Be specific.  Don't use fluff words or phrases, especially in your objective and key accomplishments. Show, don't tell, .e.g. instead of saying \"developed outstanding customer service skills\" say \"served a high volume of customers while offering impeccable service.\"",

      "body": "Norm MacDonald has a very interesting style of comedy that I personally like.  Last year my wife and I went to an Adam Sandler comedy tour and Norm was the secret, special comedian guest.  \n\nThe entire time Norm was up on stage, he had a cigarette in his hand.  Between jokes, punchlines and a pause he would start to light his cigarette and then at the very last moment stop. \n\nHe was up there for about 20 minutes or so and he had me hooked.  The others, even Spade, Sandler, etc.  myself or other audience members would zone out because of bad jokes or dis-interest.  IMO, Spade was pretty bad.\n\nI realized during Norm's routine how he would use the built up anticipation of lighting his cigarette to keep the audience engaged.  At one point towards the end of the sketch, someone in the audience ran up to the stage and offered to light his cigarette to which Norm replied, \"Don't worry, I'm getting there.\" But of course he never did.  I don't know if that was staged or not, but at the end, he got the loudest and longest applause of any of the guys, even Sandler, that night.\n\nI do monthly training for a decent size group of my colleagues at work whom are around the ages of 23 to 30.  I am several years older than them and they tend to zone out, get distracted with their phones or flat out lose interest.  I did exactly what Norm did with a cigarette and a lighter (in the office no less) and it worked out beautifully.  \n\nI've also stated adding BS slide sub-titles that I steal from r/dadjokes and r/shittyaskscience to keep people engaged.  I found that no one like to be left out of humor so that has worked very well for me.  I never acknowledge the jokes or entertain the questions as to keep the training on track.  The passive nature of using humor and semi-anxiety enducing tactics seems to be quite helpful.\n\nHow can I improve this method?\n\nWhat do you guys do that works?",

      "body": "I read Dale Carnegie's book expecting some manipulative sales tactics. Instead, I found a blueprint for genuine charisma that's been hiding in plain sight for 80+ years.\n\nHere's how to actually apply the book's lessons to become someone people genuinely want to be around:\n\n1. Use their name + genuine interest. \"Hey Sarah, how did that presentation go?\" Not just \"Hey, how's it going?\" Their name + specific memory = instant connection. People light up when they realize you actually listen.\n2. Ask about their opinions, not just their day. Instead of \"How was work?\" try \"What did you think about that new policy at work?\" You're asking for their thoughts, not just facts. Makes them feel like an expert.\n3. Find something to genuinely admire. Not fake compliments. Look for something they chose or achieved. \"I love how you handled that situation\" hits different than \"Nice shirt.\" You're acknowledging their character, not just appearance.\n4. Be enthusiastically wrong. When they correct you, respond with genuine interest: \"Oh really? I had no idea! Tell me more about that.\" Most people get defensive when corrected. Charismatic people get curious. But don't overdo this because it can make people dislike you.\n5. Let them teach you something. \"How did you learn to do that?\" \"What's your secret?\" Everyone has expertise in something. When you position yourself as their student, they feel valuable and smart.\n6. Remember the small details. \"How's your mom feeling after that surgery?\" \"Did you ever finish that book you mentioned?\" This isn't stalking but caring enough to remember what matters to them.\n\nCarnegie understood that everyone walks around with an invisible sign that says \"Make me feel important.\" Charismatic people are just really good at reading that sign.\n\nMost people are self-centered so when you listen to others with intent you become more social.\n\nThe mistakes I made early on:\n\n* Trying to be the most interesting person in the room instead of the most interested\n* Complimenting things people couldn't control instead of choices they made\n* Waiting for my turn to talk instead of actually listening\n* Making everything about me instead of about them\n\nThe less you try to impress people, the more impressive you become.\n\nIf you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/socialengineering_how_to_apply_the_book_how_to_win_friends_and/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/habits_how_to_speak_so_that_people_respect_you_learned/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1).

      "body": "I used to be someone who got agitated very quickly.\n\nI got tired of looking like that. So I figured out a social engineering tip to NEVER let anyone get to you. It’s pretty simple, some people already do this automatically, so this might be common sense for those some.\n\nBefore I go over the steps, it’s important to realize why people make backhanded comments, jabs and under the table insults.\n\nIt’s to get you emotional.  \nIt’s to get a rise out of you.  \nIt’s to get you to get flustered.\n\nThey do this to gain a sense of control.\n\nThink of this way. Negative emotions and control are *inverse*.\n\nThe more the negative emotions you display, the less control you have.  \nThe more control you have, the less negative emotions are displayed.\n\nBut there’s a bigger problem.\n\nIf someone is able to get you flustered in a public setting, the snowball starts rolling down the hill.\n\nYou’ll realize you are flustered.  \nYou’ll recognize others see you flustered.  \nYou’ll become even more anxious and in your head.\n\nThen…\n\nYou’ll become even more flustered.  \nYou’ll look even more flustered in front of others.  \nYou’ll become even more anxious than you were before.\n\nRinse and repeat. Now you’ve lost control of the situation.\n\nIt becomes a nasty cycle.\n\nThe trick is to never **show** that what was said bothered you. We are only humans, no one is ever 100% confident. It’s more pragmatic to learn how to get around unnecessary comments.\n\nIn order to do this, you must know exactly how to respond.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n\n1. Catch when someone makes a backhanded comment.\n\nExample A: “He’s so much better than you at pickle ball.”  \nExample B: “You really think you are better looking than him?”  \nExample C: “Why’d you wear that?”\n\n2. Figure out which emotion or state of mind arises because of that comment.\n\nExample A: Defensiveness  \nExample B: Embarrassment  \nExample C: Insecurity\n\n3. Determine the opposite emotion or state of mind.\n\nExample A: Receptiveness  \nExample B: Indifference  \nExample C: Confidence\n\n(Example B is not exactly opposite but still works)\n\n4. Respond as if you were feeling that opposite emotion.\n\nExample A: *“He really is! His serve is amazing, I need to work on that.”*  \nExample B: Nonchalantly *“Ah yeah, he really is.”*  \nExample C: *“I think I look great!”*\n\nThis works because you responded in the exact opposite way they expected you to. Most of the times, they won’t know what to say next.\n\nThey’ll be at a loss for words. You’ll still be in control.\n\nIf anyone has any other cool methods or how this could be improved would love to hear about it.",

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaA96-4-aDU&list=PLoFxGWSkbC8S9evnTUTxLfbYQhkBhY4KC) might help you with this shift. [WATCH HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaA96-4-aDU&list=PLoFxGWSkbC8S9evnTUTxLfbYQhkBhY4KC)\n\nIt is the fastest way to show people you are unoffended by their slights, and for that reason, people will respect you more. It is the bedrock of **being nonreactive** and making people believe you see the best in them. \n\nPeople will rally around and support those are nonreactive and capable of seeing their strength and beauty - not their weakness. They will be willing to be influenced by you, not because you used a technique - but because they want to be influenced by you. They want a world that is lead by a nonreactive leader that holds no grudge against them, because it communicates too things: strength under pressure, and the opportunity for them to be a big part of your future.\n\nIn this playlist, [WATCH HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaA96-4-aDU&list=PLoFxGWSkbC8S9evnTUTxLfbYQhkBhY4KC), you will find more of the social engineering hacks you are looking for, but this is by far the best one to start with.",

      "body": "Around 1 or 2 years ago I was eagerly anticipating an announcement for a game I had wanted to play for months. The developers released a trailer, and it was great, but something else caught my eye. They were opening a closed beta for a limited number of people. Not only would said 'people' be able to play the game up until release, it also granted them a free copy of the game when it does actually release.\n\nA few days passed and suddenly a lot of streamers and popular YouTubers began uploading gameplay videos. It seemed the beta was essentially being used as a marketing tool. \n\nI desperately wanted to play the game so instead of scrambling within giveaways for the few keys that were being tossed about I tried to think outside the box. Who else would get a key? Friends and family of the developers of course. \n\nThe game had a website, I ran a check and returned the name of the person who owned that website and his phone number. Another quick check and I had confirmed he worked for the game company. Within 5 minutes I had the guy up on Facebook.\n\nI found a friend of his, not a close acquaintance but not distant either, they had attended university together and hadn't seemed to have spoke since. \n\nFuck it, I was going to pretend to be his friend from university, I sent him a text. \n\nI can't remember the exact wording but it went something like this:\n\n>\"Hey [name] it's [name] from university! Heard [the game] is getting pretty popular, how's development going?\" \n\nWe sent a few messages back and forth, I made sure I continued to ask open questions about his game to avoid the attention turning to myself. I also kept things on first name terms as I didn't know if this was illegal or anything. I was just [name] and he seemed to know me.\n\nI decided to make an attempt to secure a beta key. \n\n>\"Yeah I've only heard great things about the game, good job! Heard there's a few beta keys being given out, you don't have a spare one do you? :D\"\n\nHe generated a key for me and I got to play the game months before everyone else and continue to play to this day.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Very few beta keys for a game being given out, found the name and phone number of a developer, acted as one of his friends from university and was given a key.",

Someone makes a claim on X subject, then someone else refutes it with a list of articles, videos etc debunking it. However, the list is not entirely true.  For example\n\nPerson 1: \"This political candidate is a truthful\". \n\nPerson 2:  \"Here's all the times said candidate has lied... *long ass list*\n\nNow the problem is the list is so long Person 1 won't have time to debunk every single lie. And by the time they do the comment will be too high up for it to matter. As long as a few of the examples are notable then you can pad out the list through half truths and outright lies.\n\nI think it's indicative of a larger problem. Attention spans are shortening and people are taking advantage of that. No one's going to read the list, they just need confirmation of their existing beliefs. \n\nI see this so often and weirdly they always get guilded. Is there a name for this? Basically just overloading people with nonsense mixed with slight truths.\n\nSlightly related as well:\n\nI realised even Reddit doesn't read articles. Here's a way to test. Go to a post about a long article. You can straight up lie about whatever is in the article and people will believe you.",

Her mistake was that she posted her name and phone number, because obviously, there are creeps who go after anything that has a chance to be female.\n\nThis guy, who called himself Ivan, started calling my girlfriend on an almost daily basis. At first, we were just fucking with him, but after a while it became boring and the guy just wouldn't stop. She asked him to stop calling her and sending her \"goo morning\" texts every goddamn day, but he didn't listen.\n\nSo I took it upon myself to stop him.\n\nFirst, I called his network provider's call center to determine whether his number was pre paid or post paid. I just told them that I need to check if there are any unpaid bills for \"my wife's\" number. They just told me that I must be mistaken since the number in question is pre paid. Step one completed.\n\nNow, this made things harder since the guy basically had a burner. The next thing I did may not have been smart, but it was effective.\nI have a really good phone number; the format is XYYXYY, almost like a company's number. The thing is, it's so similar to a certain company's number that I get calls almost every day. I used this to my advantage.\n\nI sent him a text, which read like a typical promotional message for a prize contest. \n\n    Congratuations! Your number has been randomly chosen, and by replying to this message, you'll enter [company]'s official contest where you could win the [main prize]. Just reply with your first and last name and address\n\netc.\n\nIt was a bit different since it wasn't in English, but that's the main idea.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the guy replied with the details. He didn't have a typical name for my country, so \n\n    Unfortunately, our system didn't recognize your details. Please try again in the format of\n                           NAME\n                        LAST NAME\n                         ADDRESS\n\nIt worked and the guy confirmed it. Now I have everything.  I was prepared to go to the police, or even deal with him myself even if he was a few hundred kilometres away. But then he just stopped calling. He might have sensed that something's wrong, I don't know. But he just stopped.\n\nI still have his details, just in case.",

This has happened to me once in college. I was out with my one classmate and her group of friends. They were completely ignoring me some conversations and I sort of took it as them being closer to each other than they are to me. So I didn’t read too much into it. I felt excluded, ignored, and dismissed, sure, but didn’t take it too personally. I do not think they are mean or that they did it on purpose, but maybe didn’t see value in me being part of the conversation? What are your thoughts?\n\nI know that in the interview, Blake was probably projecting her insecurity when being congratulated for having a pregnancy, which I felt was miscommunication starting off and then the whole interview became passive aggressive and resentful for the rest of it. That’s some context to this situation (doesn’t make it right, but we can at least see why it happened here). But what about the instances in which people just ignore you for no rhyme or reason?",

The sub has no FAQ, the mods are unresponsive, and every couple weeks we have people looking for beginner tools. \n\nI have a decade+ experience myself, time spent in this sub, learning new things from everyone, teaching others, and I've read all manner of books on the subject, and I can say first hand that **I can't do this alone.**\n\n/r/SocialEngineering, lets get some ideas and recommended sources put together, huh? My goal end product is in three parts.\n\nI'd like to write a document to serve as an unofficial course text for beginners, organized into sections going from such basic things as just talking to people and being social in the first place, ending with simple methods of winning people over. Each section will have activities of some kind to complete, testing each specific new skill. For this first document, its gonna be incredibly simple. Kindergarten of Social Interactions. \n\nMy goal for the second part is a document that is beginner oriented, and will feature the basics of social manipulations. Going over questioning, FORM, pretext, etc the whole bag yadda yadda yadda. The activities and tests in this one will focus on a goal outside of the interaction itself. Information, a name, something. But real beginner level. I'd love to cite historical instances here. \n\nThe advanced document is one I hope can be for serious Social Engineers, Pentesters, and perhaps even elite sales people. I'd like it to cover both social principles and psychological laws that govern social interactions. The activities here would challenge people to take their knowledge of these ideas and principles into consideration as well and perhaps develop their own tactics, strategies, and such.\n\nLast, and most certainly not least, I'd love to create a video companion to each one and I'd love to make these free resources.\n\n\nThese won't be complete, as social engineering is as ever changing and growing as the human population. I hope that with the help of this sub reddit, we can realize this soon. Here's my call to action: if there is an idea you have now, give it out. Everyone involved will be credited unless the indicate otherwise. Give any and all ideas. What information goes where? How do we format it? Who is in the videos? Any skills to contribute? Is this a shitty idea? Let me know. \n\nTL;DR, you are now uncomfortably aware of the flavor of your teeth.",

      "body": "\"Thin slicing\" — the psychological tendency for people to make assumptions about your attractiveness, personality, and all sorts of other things within seconds of meeting you — happens all the time. \n\nIncluding at work. \n\nResearch suggests that colleagues and would-be clients make snap assessments about your earning potential, chance of getting promoted, and level of success. \n\nIn a 2011 Canadian study, 87 university students were shown photos of a man in professional or casual dress, and were asked what they expected his workplace outcomes to be.\n\nThe differences were obvious. Not only were the well-dressed men expected to make more money, they were expected to be promoted more rapidly. Meanwhile, the sloppily dressed guys were expected to receive more verbal harassment at work. \n\nIn a 2013 British-Turkish study, 274 participants had five seconds to look to at photos of men wearing suits — one group in tailored garb, the other in off-the-peg outfits. \n\nThe results may make you want to visit a tailor. \n\n\"The man was rated more positively on all attributes apart from trustworthiness when pictured in the bespoke suit,\" the authors wrote. \"On the evidence of this study it appears men may be advised to purchase clothing that is well‐tailored, as it can positively enhance the image they communicate to others.\"\n\nSexism is present here, too. A 1990 study found that when women dress more masculinely — straight silhouettes, angular lines, and dark colors — they are considered to be more hireable than women in more flowing, feminine garb.\n\nSo what can we do with all this info? \n\nHere's what the experts advise:\n\n• Look like you care about how you look. \"Carelessness seems to signal that you don't respect your coworkers or yourself,\" says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of \"Executive Presence.\" \"You certainly don't respect the client if you show up with soup on your tie or bitten nails, anything to make you look unkempt.\" \n\n• Tailor your look to the situation. \"If it's Microsoft, it's one outfit; in the US Army, it's another,\" says longtime executive recruiter Russell Reynolds. \"You have to look like you belong to the group, [and] you have to look a little better than the group.\" To do that, Hewlett says to \"pattern yourself\" after someone who's particularly good at dressing a bit better than the rest of the group. \n\n• Stay away from the suggestive. \"For women, a major blunder is sexually provocative clothing,\" Hewlett says. \"It's tremendously undermining of your gravitas, because it's either distracting or threatening. No matter your projection of your capabilities, if your skirt is too short or your neckline too plunging, you get struck off the list for a big client meeting or a promotion.\" \n\n\nSource: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-instantly-appear-successful-2015-2",

      "body": "Last night I experimented with a wheelchair by attending a football game with close to 4000 people. I had 2 friends with me and we are all somewhat the same attractiveness. I was new to the area and thus unrecognizable, and no one questioned my fake disability. \n\nSeating for the handicap is not any good either. being in a chair you couldn't see over the fence that surrounded the field when on the sidelines, and the balcony handicap positions were far and isolated. \n \nInitiating conversation was easy. I would accidentally bump into a group and then wait for them to apologized to me. At which point I would make a joke and then introduce myself and my friends. We would chat for a few seconds and then we would form a standard group conversation circle. There was a few people that asked me a few questions about what happened and I tried several stories ranging from believable to ridiculous depending on how gullible the individual seemed, of 50 encounters only one person called me on it. \n\nI am decently tall person and I am used to towering over women and some men at 6'1''. However, because I was wheelchair bound I started feeling vulnerable as I didn't have my height advantage. I felt detached because I was at breast height and couldn't look someone directly in the eyes, people were harder to hear at that distance, and that the chair made me wider and further back from the rest of the circle. Whatever it was, I was not part of the group. \n\n**TLDR:** Being in a wheelchair is miserable, the cost of being unable to communicate and the perpetual feeling of being detached is dreadful. With that said, I was a kick ass wingman and I was physically comfortable the entire game. I have a new found sympathy for those with a disabilities.",

      "body": "Have you ever felt like you were ready to leave a conversation but didn't know how to get out of it?\n\nI get this question a lot, so let's get it out of the way.\n\nThe reason this happens is because we tend to want the other person's permission or approval before we leave a conversation.\n\nWe don't want to seem rude, and we don't want to upset them in any way, so we wait for them to acknowledge that the conversation is over.\n\nThe way to get around this \"feeling stuck\" is no huge secret.\n\nYou just have to realise that your decision to leave the conversation is not a two-person decision. It's your decision, and yours alone.\n\nWhen you're ready to go, all it takes is a simple...\n\n*\"Well it was good talking to you. I've gotta get going.\"*\n\nor *\"Anyway... good chatting, man. I'm gonna go mingle.\"*\n\nor *\"So hey it was great meeting you. I'm gonna see if I can meet some more new people.\"*\n\nBut what's important is the **way you say it.**\n\nThere has to be a finality to it.\n\nIf your tone and body language communicate that you're waiting for their permission... the conversation will continue until they're ready to end it.\n\nSo say it like you've completely made up you're mind and you're leaving **right now.**\n\nNot aggressive, not rude... just *\"Cool man, well I've gotta go\"* ... and physically your body is ALREADY in the motion of leaving.\n\nAs you say it, you're *already* holding your hand out for a handshake, or you're giving them a pat on the shoulder, or you're going for a fist bump, or whatever it is you do.\n\nAnd if you don't do anything like that... pick one of those things. Because sticking your hand out forces them to stop talking, to find out what you're doing. AND touching them in some way shows that you're not saying \"F#ck you, I'm leaving\" ... you're saying \"Hey I appreciated this chat, and now I'm ready to move on.\"\n\nYou can also follow it up with \"Let's talk soon\" or \"See you on Friday\" as you're **already** walking away.\n\nNow think of a time when someone did this to you... when they assertively ended the conversation without waiting for your permission, but expressed that they enjoyed talking to you.\n\nDid you like them less for it?\n\nUnlikely. In fact you probably like them more. Because their assertiveness made them seem important, confident, cool. But they did it with warmth at the same time.\n\n**So whenever you're ready to leave, no matter how soon... just stick your hand out and end it with finality (and a smile).**\n\nThey'll end up valuing you more.\n\nIf you want more actionable advice like this, get your daily dose of communication hacks and people skills [here](https://beardstrokings.com/learn/?utm_source=rseng-leave).",

      "body": "**“What’s the craziest thing you want to achieve?\"**\n\nThis is simply the question, \"What's your goal in life?\" ... but morphed into something less pointy.\n\nYes, it sounds a little odd when you read it, but let me explain it...\n\n*\"What's your goal in life\"* is the raw question. It uncovers the raw fact that you're trying to learn.\n\nIf you were to just ask someone the raw question outright though ... well, it'd feel weird coming out of nowhere. It's kind of aggressive and robotic and almost like you're a hostile machine that's invading my territory to extract facts from me.\n\nAnd I have defences against that particular scenario, you see. Because I can simply lie to you, or not tell you the whole truth.\n\nWhich is what I probably will do if I'm getting dodgy vibes from you.\n\n*BUT…*\n\nIf you morph the question a little, to something like *\"What's the craziest thing you want to achieve\"*, it's more likely to bypass my defences.\n\nBecause if you'd just asked me \"what's your goal in life,\" I might be worried that you'd think my goal was **crazy**. And that you were going to judge me for it. So I might hide it from you.\n\nBut because you actually used the word \"crazy\" in your question, I know you're expecting something crazy... so you've given me a way to open up to you without really feeling like I'm opening myself up to your judgement.\n\nNow you might also be thinking that using the word \"achieve\" feels weird... but this is the point I was making at the beginning of this email. You're going to have to start using all of the tools available to you if you want to get better at communicating. You're going to have to try new things.\n\n\"Achieve\" feels weird because it's very specific. It'll feel to them like you've been wondering about your own future achievements... and that's exactly the reaction you want.\n\n... Because you wondering about it yourself gives you a genuine reason to be asking me about my goals. Which makes me feel like the question is  **less**  about ME and **more** about YOU. Like you're trying to figure something out for yourself.\n\nSo I'll be more inclined to help you.\n\nAnd also, it's really just not as weird as you might think. If someone asked you that question, you wouldn't even notice the wording. You'd just answer it.\n\nSo the lesson here is this:\n**The same question asked in different ways will get you different responses.**\n\nAnd if you want learn how to connect with people deeply through conversation, [check out this guide](https://beardstrokings.com/break-out-of-your-shell/?utm_source=rseng-day1).

      "body": "The only way you can get people to do anything is by giving them what they want.\n\nBut what the heck do people want?\n\nSigmund Freud used to say that everything we humans do springs from two motives: our sex urge and our desire to be great.\n\nWhile this might sound over simplistic, there's one thing Freud was absolutely right. The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the main things that truly distinguishes us humans from other animals.\n\nNow let me tell you a short story. It involves the legendary Rockstar David Bowie.\n\nIn 2009, before publishing a big cover story on the many lives of David Bowie, *Word magazine* interviewed a bunch of journalists who'd met Bowie.\n\nThis was the moment when they all realized that Bowie used the same persuasion technique on almost all of them. This was a something he'd been doing for years. He wasn't really trying to be sneaky or trying to trick them. It was a simple way to charm and influence people.\n\nLong story short, Bowie's team would book journalists for a 45-minute interview. And about 5 minutes before the interview ended, his press officer would show up to wrap it up.\n\nThen Bowie would smile and say, \"Look, I know we're on a schedule, but - honestly, we're having such fun here, could we do an extra 15 minutes? This is going really well.\"\n\nIn reality, Bowie was scheduled for an hour - but the journalist didn't know that.\n\nSo the journalist would react as any normal human being would react. The journalist would think, \"Wow! I'm so interesting that even a legend like David Bowie wants to chat with me for 15 extra minutes\".\n\n[Whatever album Bowie was promoting, this simple persuasion trick would usually earn him good press, and glowing album reviews](https://creativesamba.substack.com/p/15-extra-minutes-20-02-10).",

      "body": "This is something i've been observing for a long time. I don't know if there is an official name for this technique, so I'm just going to call it 'BS overload'.\n\n'BS overload' is a when you surround a true fact by a lot of similar, but obviously false facts. The true fact gets made to look ridiculous by it's association with the false facts. This puts people in a close-minded state, causing them to automatically reject any fact, related to the topic, that could be true. \n\nThe best way to explain this is through examples:\n\nSo right now, we're in an 'everything causes cancer' mindset as a culture. In the news, constantly we are hearing that red meat, wine, mouthwash, hair spray, cell phones, sun cream, x-rays, etc, etc cause cancer. \n\nAs a culture, we get completely overloaded with hundreds of these examples to the point that we think, \"well if I stopped doing all these things I wouldn't be able to do anything!\". This leads people to roll their eyes at such statements and sarcastically say, \"everything causes cancer\". \n\nThis has an interesting psychological effect. It causes people to completely ignore the problem. For example, let's say that cell phones do cause cancer (for purposes of explanation). If that get's said in the news, people will ignore it, as they've been overloaded with a lot of BS examples. It stops people considering the actual truth. \n\nAnother example is Conspiracy Theories. There are some many clear BS conspiracy theories that people laugh at anyone who has a conspiracy theory. This causes people to dismiss ALL conspiracy theories, even if one came up that was true. \n\nI find it very interesting. I'm not suggesting that this is something been done consciously, but it is interesting to think that when you surround truth in enough bull shit, the truth gets seen as bull shit too. \n\nFinally, the same technique works if you give people too much true information at once that would affect their lives. If I told you that X definitely causes cancer, you might stop doing X. But if I told you, X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D and E all definitely cause cancer (and you believe me), the overload of too much information would cause you to ignore all of it. \n\nDepending on how well this post is received, I might start contributing regularly to r/SocialEngineering\n\nTL;DR By surrounding a true fact with a lot of obviously false facts, you can make the true fact look ridiculous.",

      "body": "Used to be the guy who said yes to everything, avoided conflict at all costs, and wondered why I felt resentful all the time. This book was a wake-up call.\n\n1. Stop seeking approval from everyone. I was exhausting myself trying to make everyone happy. Realized that needing constant validation was actually selfish I was more concerned with how people saw me than actually helping them.\n2. It's okay to have needs and express them. Spent years pretending I didn't need anything from anyone. Turns out, having needs is human and expressing them clearly actually makes relationships better.\n3. Stop doing covert contracts. I'd do nice things expecting something in return but never communicating that expectation. Then I'd get mad when people didn't read my mind. Super toxic pattern.\n4. Set boundaries without apologizing. \"No\" is a complete sentence. I don't need to justify every boundary with a 10-minute explanation about why I can't do something.\n5. Take care of yourself first. Not in a selfish way, but you can't give what you don't have. Started prioritizing my own physical and mental health instead of always putting others first.\n6. Stop avoiding conflict. Conflict isn't inherently bad as it's often necessary for healthy relationships. Learning to disagree respectfully instead of just going along with everything.\n7. Be direct and honest. Instead of hinting or being passive-aggressive, just say what you mean. People respect directness way more than I thought they would.\n\nThe book can be a bit intense and some parts didn't apply to me, but the core message about authentic relationships vs. people-pleasing really hit home. Anyone else struggle with the \"nice guy\" attitude? I realized I had this for 6 years until I read this book\n\nIf you liked this post perhaps I can tempt you with my [weekly newsletter](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/socialengineering_7_lessons_from_no_more_mr_nice_guy_that_helped_me&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1https://www.theimprovementletter.com/?utm_source=r/habits_how_to_speak_so_that_people_respect_you_learned/&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reddit_post&utm_term=Post&utm_content=1).

      "body": "Here’s 33 (more) things I've learned along the way that I hope help ***you*** in your journey:\n\n1.    Kindness is the best deal going. You can keep giving it and it doesn’t cost you anything.\n\n2.    You can only be offended if you let yourself be offended. \n\n3.    When someone is drowning, don’t tell them they should have taken swimming lessons.  \nHelp first. Educate second.\n\n4.    Your struggles today will be your accomplishments tomorrow. Keep going.\n\n5.    Building resilience isn’t something that comes and goes with your mood. Resilience is your intention and becomes a part of you. When that happens, nothing can stop you.\n\n6.    At 23 I worried what people thought of me.  \nAt 43 I realized they weren’t even thinking about me.  \nAt 73 I really don’t care that much about what people do think of me.  \nAdopt that one early.\n\n7.    Books are like the years in your life. It's not how many you have, it’s how good they are.\n\n8.    With hope you can endure and accomplish anything. \n\n9.    What you think of me is none of my business.\n\n10. Nobody gets to their deathbed upset they tried too many things. But plenty of people get there with regrets for the things they didn’t try.\n\n11. You can only be in a bad mood if you let yourself.\n\n12. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness.\n\n13. The pain you feel today is the strength you’ll feel tomorrow. Keep pushing forward.\n\n14. Never say anything to yourself that you wouldn’t say to a loved one.\n\n15. We make the best decisions we can, with the information we have at that time.  \nGive yourself a break.\n\n16. Say something. Do something. Be something.\n\n17. Believe in yourself. Don’t listen to the critics. They’re either envious or they can’t do it themselves.\n\n18. Your age is up to you. I’m 73 but I believe and act like I’m 19. Find your *happy* age. It’s more important than the years.\n\n19. Action is the medicine for Fear of Failure. Just start moving.\n\n20. Lead with your heart but manage with your head. I absolutely made that mistake. More than once.\n\n21. You will never go wrong being too kind to someone. Sometimes it will feel like they are taking advantage of you. But that’s on them, not you.\n\n22. You can tell the strength of a relationship by the number of calluses on the upper lip from biting it.\n\n23. Don’t stay stuck on every idea. Trees bend for a reason.\n\n24. To become successful, be useful. Be useful to enough people and success will find you.\n\n25. Life doesn’t come with an unlimited number of chances. Don’t hesitate.\n\n26. Forgetting something is the universe’s way of telling you to be more present.\n\n27. If you don’t expect anything, you’ll never be disappointed.\n\n28. I’m not anti-social. I’m just not very pro-social.\n\n29. So little time. So many books.\n\n30. Everyone has their first day on the job. Give them a break.\n\n31. Money is important to have (and usually necessary), until your happiness becomes more important.\n\n32. It isn’t over until YOU say it’s over.\n\n33. My best tip and hope for us: Live and let live.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes clearer.  \nSometimes you’ll be up and sometimes you’ll be down.  \nBut nothing ever stays the same. And that's ok.  \nEnjoy the ride.\n\nOnward!  \nLouie\n\n📌Please add something *y*ou know to be true, in the comments.  \nWe learn together.",

      "title": "I Hate Waking Up Early: A Guide to Un-f******g Your Sleep Schedule",
      "body": "Look, I get it. Your bed is comfy, mornings are evil, and anyone who says they're a \"morning person\" is either lying or psychotic. But here's the thing - your 4AM gaming sessions and Reddit doom-scrolling aren't doing you any favors. And no, being a \"night owl\" isn't a personality trait, it's just what happens when you've convinced your body that 2AM is actually dinner time.\n\nWant to know how I know this shit works? The Navy taught me - by force. See, when you get to boot camp, the first thing they do is keep you up for over 24 hours. They feed you some bullshit about \"Just grab your gear, stencil it, go through these basic instructions, and then you can go to bed!\" But by the time they walk you through getting your clothes and marching you to your first berthing, it's already morning and they're dragging your sleep-deprived ass to breakfast.\n\nHere's the genius part - they keep you up for about 36 hours for two reasons:\n\n1. To put you in a room where Master Chiefs can yell at you about whether your recruiter told you to lie about smoking weed\n2. To completely reset your fucked up sleep cycle\n\nThat second part? That's what we're going to do. Well, minus the screaming Master Chiefs.\n\n**The Science Behind Your Shitty Sleep:** Here's something they didn't teach you in high school: The way your body wakes up is your brain sends a signal to your hypothalamus to raise your body temperature. Heat means wakey-wakey time. This isn't some wellness influencer bullshit - it's actual biology.\n\n**Step 1: The Morning Reset** First thing you need to do? Go outside for 15 minutes. Yes, OUTSIDE. I don't care if it's raining. I don't care if you're tired. I don't care if you look like a shambling corpse. Get your ass outside before you do anything else - before coffee, before phone, before whatever the hell else you think you need to do.\n\nWhy? Because sunlight tells your body \"oh shit, it really is time to wake up!\" More importantly, it starts a **16-hour timer**. Once that timer starts, your body will naturally want to crash when it's actually bedtime, instead of at 4AM when you're halfway through your tenth YouTube video about why dolphins are actually aliens. (Which, by the way spoiler alert: they are.)\n\n**The Actual Steps:**\n\n1. Wake up at the same time **EVERY day** (yes, even weekends, you degenerate)\n2. Go outside for 15 minutes **IMMEDIATELY**\n3. No screens for the first hour (your TikTok feed can wait)\n4. No caffeine until **AFTER** your morning sunlight\n5. Keep your room cool at night but **LET IT WARM UP** in the morning\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n\n* If you're struggling to wake up, turn off your AC or turn on a heater. Your body will get the message.\n* Walk around the block if you want, but do it in silence. No podcasts, no music. Just you and your thoughts (scary, I know).\n* If you live in a city where morning sounds include some asshat blasting music through their garbage-bag window repair, then yeah, put on headphones.\n\n**The Actual Science (For You Nerds Who Want Proof):** Look, I actually did my homework on this shit. Your eyes have these special cells called ipRGCs (yeah I'm not typing out that full name, fuck that) that basically act like your body's light sensors. When morning sunlight hits these bad boys, they send a signal to your brain's master clock - the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN if you're not trying to sound like a pretentious dickhead.\n\nThis SCN thing? It's like your body's DJ - dropping hormone beats to keep you awake during the day and sleepy at night. Morning light tells it \"Yo, start the party,\" and about 12 to 16 hours later it's like \"Last call, motherfuckers!\" That's when it starts pumping out melatonin - the hormone that makes you sleepy.\n\nThis isn't some bro-science bullshit. There are actual studies showing this works. But I'm not here to make you read scientific papers - I'm here to get your ass out of bed before noon.\n\n**The Reality Check:** This is going to suck for the first week. You're going to hate it. You're going to hate me. You're going to hate whoever showed you this post. But you know what sucks more? Being 35 and still having the sleep schedule of a college freshman during finals week.\n\n**TL;DR:** Get your ass outside first thing in the morning, keep a consistent schedule, and stop pretending your 3AM bedtime makes you special. Your body knows how to sleep - you just need to stop fighting it. Also, dolphins are definitely aliens.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**EDIT: Want to address a couple of things:**\n\n**\"What if I wake up before the sun?\"**\n\nWell first off, please pat yourself on the shoulder cause you're a trooper my friend! Not everyone wakes up at the crack of noon like some of us degenerates. If you're up before the sun, the same rules apply - just fake it 'til you make it. Bright indoor lighting is your next best bet. Hit yourself with as much light as possible (overhead lights, lamps, hell, even your fridge light if you're desperate). The goal is to trick your body into thinking it’s daytime, even if you need to turn your living room into a Vegas strip... Hmm.. Know what? Party lights! Yeah! Party lights!\n\n**\"What if I live in a place like Fargo, or Alaska, or somewhere where even the Sun as Social Anxiety and won't show up?\"**\n\nBro I got you! Get yourself a therapy lamp. 10,000 lux. That means super bright light, like daylight indoors. And **get it in blue! Blue light is easiest on the skin and eyes!** So, what is a therapy lamp? These bad boys mimic natural sunlight and can help keep your body's sleep-wake cycle in check, even if it's pitch black outside. Just park yourself in front of one for 15-30 minutes in the morning - pretend you’re basking on a tropical beach. Go make yourself a Mai Thai. You can't be drunk all day if you don't start in the morning, so 2 birds, one cup!\n\nAnd once the sun *does* come up? Get your ass outside and soak it in like your life depends on it. Because, well... it kind of does.\n\n(Note: I do not endorse alcoholism or morning/day drinking, despite me having a career as a Sailor in the US Navy. Not openly at least.)",

The world does not rest on my shoulders.\n3. I have stopped bargaining with vegetable & fruit vendors. A few pennies more is not going to break me, but it might help the poor fellow save for his daughter’s school fees.\n4. I leave my waitress a nice tip (preferably in cash). The extra money might bring a smile to their face. They are toiling much harder for a living than I am.\n5. I have learned not to correct people even when I know they are wrong. The onus of making everyone perfect is not on me. Peace is more precious than perfection.\n6. I give compliments freely & generously. Compliments are a mood enhancer not only for the recipient, but also for me. And a small tip for the recipient of a compliment, never, NEVER turn it down, just say \"Thank You.”\n7. I walk away from people who don't value me. They might not know my worth, but I do.\n8. I remain cool when someone plays dirty to outrun me in the rat race. I am not a rat & neither am I in any race.\n9. I am not embarrassed by my emotions. It’s my emotions that make me human.\n10. I have learned to live each day as if it's the last. After all, it might be the last.\n11. I keep my aches and pains to myself unless specifically asked. It’s nice to share but only when invited. We all have our health issues as we get older but that doesn’t mean we want to hear a non-stop litany of everyone else’s physical ailments.\n12. I am responsible for my happiness, and I owe it to myself. So I am trying to do what makes me happy. Happiness is a choice. You can be happy at any time, just choose to be!\n13. I’ve accepted the past, look forward to the future but always strive to live in the present.\n\nLastly:  Be Grateful!! Live a life of gratitude and appreciation. For all its flaws and trials, this is the only life we have, so be grateful for it. Appreciate everything, the good and the bad cuz that's what life is about.\n\nTake what you can use, ignore the rest, live a good life and be kind to each other, we're all we've got.",

      "body": "So, to start off I have ADD and possibly also Aspie (didn't get to official diagnose, just multiple doctors hints)\n\nI have spent my entire life alone, never met my father (turned out he already had a family and kids and my mom was just a teenage party fun), mother consequently abandoned me at grands. Finding any friends was nearly impossible due to my differences. Despite being really smart as a kid (learned to read and write early enough to be accused by other kids and teachers of \"learning the whole text at home by memory with help from parents\", learned programming games on C64 with only rudimentary English knowledge and logic at 12yo, didn't have books or internet) I kept failing classes, skipping entire days just to avoid bullies and social situations, being hit and laughed at by griuos of bigger boys etc... Just school life. Because of that I barely finished elementary and then did a cheap adults school of IT. No uni for me. Poor family, no internet back then, couldn't do any private stuff. I felt stupid and hated school and learning. \n\nI have spent my entire childhood and half of adulthood locking myself up in mmorpg games, doing nothing productive or positive. No jobs for years, and when I did get one I soon did something stupid socially and get fired. \n\nI have been actively hating myself and destroying my life from the start all the way till I turned 35. \nAt that moment, I was low enough to hit the bottom and that gave me something to jump up off. I went to live in another country on a whim decision. I picked up learning piano and game dev again. I picked up learning art, and languages. I fell in love with high quality music. I love simply creating and doing things again, without it being dependant on opinions of others. \n\nSince then I have learned to love myself, and not fight for others attention and acceptance. I got a well paid, high position job. I bought myself everything I have dreamed of, things that allow me to pursue my numerous hobbies and special interests that I have ignored all my life as \"childish and unworthy of time\" based on external opinions. I became egoistic to the point of actually being happy with my own happiness, not others. \n\nWhile I still lack any kind of close, or even far friends, or any family other than my gran, I feel like... Life is worth living. There are things to do out there, goals that we can reach, and reasons to exist that we ourselves can create or find, and not just hope to be \"given\". I no longer feel like waking up after sleep is competely optional, and not even welcome really. I believe I have, more or less, fixed my broken life. \n\nWhy even write all that? Because we're getting too many \"i destroyed my life at 18/20/25\" threads. You have not destroyed anything. We are all learning, all our lives, and there is no point at which you can't fix everything up - no matter how much you think you mess up.\n\n\n-- EDIT:\nThank you so much for all the replies and passed on love everyone! At the moment of writing I had no clue the situation will resonate with so many great people - I sincerely wish all of you to succeed as well!\n\nTo answer some of the questions that keep being asked:\n\n1. I have moved to the UK, and lived there for several months but that is not where I got my current job - I have failed there terribly, worked the lowest night shift jobs there are, and walked hungry, sick and broken more times than I can count before coming back for those, and many other reasons. I still think it was one of my best decisions to try, ever - it taught me a LOT and living there with the thought of staying at first, and trying to integrate and think like people in that country let me experience a completely different society, mindset and culture, nothing that simply being a tourist and travelling around gives you - and that is what I believe was a big part of what helped me change things up when I finally came back. A fresh look on life and how things can work. I did not see going back as a \"failure\" and end of the world - but simply another part of the adventure!\n\n2. For the people asking for the way I got my job - I am sorry, despite my bearded, long-haired looks I am not Jesus and I do not have all the answers. I can only share what helped me, but can not guarantee it's the \"one way\" to make things work, just hope a part of it helps you too!\n\nBefore the travel, I was in a mindset of \"try to find a job you can do and like to do ['perfect' job, which doesn't exist], cherry pick, and if you find one desperately stay there because you might never find anything else!\". \nAfter coming back, I started applying to all kinds of jobs that were even close to what I could do a little bit [IT (I only had a little technical knowledge, I mainly used the PC to play games before), driving, some office work], even if I did not fully fit within the requirements.\n\nThen I have found the job I am at right now.\n \n- It required some administration experience... I thought well, due to my years of MMO addiction and authority issues I was always creating and leading my own guilds, working spritesheets of members, coding little programs to help me manage large numbers of individuals, that's... kind of like administration right? Right?\n- It required knowledge of multiple systems I have either never used, or even heard about [Active Directory for example... I simply spent a few hours watching youtube tutorials here.], [Another example was a weird system I could not find tutorials for anywhere, which turned out to be an internal system used in the services and built for them, so understandably there were not any books or youtube tutorials about it]\n- It required knowledge of certain government laws about the medical system, which luckily were available on the gov websites, so I gave it a few reads - I have never worked a position like that before, or had any knowledge about laws like that, so it was a completely new experience\n\nSimply put, I tried my best to fill up holes and put in time to be a \"fit\" INSTEAD of [like previously] instantly flagging it as \"I have no experience in this, I don't know what those things are, it's not a position for me\", and then I went on with it - applied for the position with all the necessary documents, not just a simple \"hey, im interested, hit me up\", and went to the interview when invited - without any kind of hope of getting it, or despairing that I might not - simply to see how will it go, how does it look like, and if I needed to prepare anything better next time. Seeing the interview as just another experience, and not something that \"decides my life and if I fail I'm doomed\". Not something \"way above me\". Just like with all the previous interviews I went to after changing my approach to them. And this time, after a few days or weeks [by the end of that month if I'm not wrong], when I did not even expect them to contact me again - I have received the call, and started a week after that. :-) \nNo matter what was it - luck, random chance, whatever you call it - it would not happen if I did not do the steps I did - preparing, learning, and then just going there. It would not happen if I gave up after one of the previous failures and lack of calls back. \n\nThat's what I think worked for me - doing my best to prepare, not worrying overmuch over things I can't control [can't suddenly pop 5 years of experience in something you had none in] and just keeping trying, no matter how many times you fail and feel like it will never work.\n\n3. Yes, my life is still not \"perfect\", and I never expect it to because that's not possible. There will always be problems. But I think it's important to not focus on them, and thinking your life is over because of one too many rejections, and instead appreciating the good things that happen - no matter how small they are. And I still think, as of right now and compared to MYSELF from the past - my life and attitude is fixed, and I am ready for the challenges ahead - much more than I ever was before. Giving up is no longer an option that I see as a \"possibility\" in life.\n\n4. How do I deal with having no friends, wife/girl or much family [other than granma - I am so fucking grateful for everything she and gran, when he was alive, did, even if there were problems and it was not a \"perfect situation\" and for her simply being there - if she needs me I will come back from another country, drop my job and sell everything I own if that's what's needed to help. I am not very social, but (or maybe because of that) I believe if you do have someone close, even just a single person, they are worth more than ANYTHING you could ever own or accomplish.] - close socializing in the real world is pretty much not possible for me. I no longer have a paralyzing social phobia induced by years of getting bullied as a kid, I can be friendly and talk with people, and I can stand up to them and react pretty bad when I sense they're the bully type [instead of making me feel helpless it just triggers me now], but forming a deeper connection just does not seem to work anymore irl. Therefore I find ways to silence the loneliness so it does not keep me from doing things that make me happy - I got a VR headset and when it gets bad I go into VR chat and just hang around people. It's much easier for someone like me to just join a group of people chatting in there and join in, where irl it would be pretty damn awkward - imagine having a dinner with your work colleagues, talking about personal shit and suddenly some random stranger stands next to you and stares! :-D I also believe, due to my numerous hobbies and limited time, that having internet friends simply suits me better. We can always talk or do things whenever I have my phone on me, I don't have to sacrifice piano time, or game dev time to travel across the city for an hour and then spend time half enjoying it, half hoping I could already go back to doing my things. \n\nSo, again - simply found my niche. Didn't overthink everyone saying it's \"wrong\", \"go out and meet real people\", \"force yourself to be someone else\", \"internet friends are not friends\" or care about it - I know this works for me, it fills the hole, and is more beneficial than the other thing, so I simply do that. And if I find a similar person, that also needs just that somewhere deep in the internets - who's to judge if it's \"right\" or \"wrong\" if we're both better off because of it? :-) If you can't move a rock, find a way around it!\n\nThat's what mostly worked for me - if any of it can make your day better, find your own way or just rekindle the hope a bit - I'll be happy for you! And I'm so, SO sorry for the edit being such a brain dump - I just chased the squirrels all over there.. Hopefully it's at least partially readable.\n\nMuch love, never give up. <3",

      "body": "Last year, I realized I was totally mentally burned out. Every free second, I was reaching for my phone. Whether it was mindlessly scrolling Instagram, checking for notifications, or cycling through the same three apps for no reason, it felt like my brain was stuck in a loop 90% of the time.\n\nIt wasn’t just about wasting time... I was restless during “quiet” moments. Waiting in line, sitting in silence, even being on a walk… my hand would automatically go to my phone. \n\nSo I decided to do something drastic: a dopamine reset. I knew I had to retrain my brain to find satisfaction outside of endless scrolling. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked better than anything else I’ve tried. \n\nHere’s what helped:\n\n1. **A 30-Day Detox:** I started by cutting my screen time in half over the first two weeks. I didn’t go cold turkey, but I set up strict limits for social media and distractions.\n2. **Redirect Habits:** Every time I wanted to grab my phone, I reached for a book or went outside instead. It sounds small, but it made a huge difference in breaking the cycle.\n3. **Strict App Blocking:** I set up windows that were impossible to skip—mornings and evenings became completely phone-free. It’s wild how much clarity you can get when you’re not bombarded with notifications first thing.\n4. **Relearn Boredom:** At first, being bored was *hard*. But over time, I realized it’s where all the best ideas and calm moments come from. Now, I actually enjoy those “empty” minutes.\n\nIt’s been a few months, and I feel more focused, calm, and present than I have in years. I’m still not perfect—some days, I slip back into old habits. But overall, I’ve learned that finding balance with your phone isn’t just about productivity. It’s about taking control of your mind.",

      "body": "For years, I thought my problem was a lack of motivation. I’d research the best productivity hacks, buy planners I never used, and analyze my failures like a scientist studying bacteria. But the real issue? I was waiting for the 'perfect plan' instead of taking action.\n\nI told myself I needed:\n\nThe perfect fitness plan before I could start exercising.\n\nThe perfect investment strategy before putting money into the market.\n\nThe perfect moment to start learning a new skill, otherwise, I’d just quit anyway.\n\n\nI convinced myself I was being “smart” by overanalyzing every decision. In reality, I was just procrastinating.\n\nThen something clicked. I realized that small, imperfect actions beat the best-laid plans never executed. So I made a rule:\n\n\"Do the thing at 70% readiness. Adjust later.\"\n\nI started walking instead of waiting for the perfect workout routine.\n\nI set up a simple investment plan instead of obsessing over every possible risk.\n\nI started practicing a new language, mistakes and all, instead of waiting until I \"felt ready.\"\n\nThe result? Momentum. When I stopped trying to predict the future and just did something, progress became inevitable.\n\nSo if you’re stuck in analysis paralysis, ask yourself: What could I start doing today at 70% readiness? It won’t be perfect. But it will be real. And real beats perfect every time.",

      "body": "I've gone off the deep end researching what makes a best life.\n\nI wrote this all out basically for myself to organize my thoughts and give myself guidance, but figured it could be very useful to people who like the \"Rules for Life\" approach to things.\n\nHow I see it, life breaks down into 5 main categories\n\n1. Purpose\n2. Relationships\n3. Health\n4. Finances\n5. Environment\n\nYou can basically take any other category and fit it in there imo.\n\n**I realized that you don't need to be a 10/10 in all of these areas to live your best life.**\n\nFor example, once you get to an 8 out of 10 in any category, the incremental benefits dwindle. As an extreme example, if you have $10M, you can pretty much do whatever you want. Getting from $10M to $100M won't increase your overall happiness nearly as much as getting from $40k to $100k would. That's going from high stress to a comfortable life. MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT.\n\nSame applies for the other categories. If you're an 8 out of 10 on health, you probably look and feel pretty damn good. Maybe you're not a trained athlete but you're fit and have energy. Getting to a 10 isn't going to change your life very much.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n**But what's really interesting is that each has a minimum threshold that humans need to feel like they're living a quality life.**\n\nIf you're below any one of the following things, it's impossible to live your best life, even if you're at a 10/10 in every other category.\n\nSo what are the minimum thresholds in each category for human happiness?\n\n# Purpose\n\n* **literally have any sense of purpose in life**\n   * people with a strong sense of purpose had a 43% lower risk of death\n   * time spent in flow states (deep work, meaningful play, creative hobbies) has a 3x stronger positive impact on happiness than passive relaxation\n   * people with high purpose had a 52% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s\n   * individuals with high purpose reported 32% lower rates of depression and 40% lower rates of anxiety\n   * high purpose was linked to 23% lower risk of heart disease and 19% lower risk of stroke\n   * every Blue Zone has a shared strong sense of ikigai (japanese for reason for being)\n   * people with a defined purpose reported 2.5x higher life satisfaction than those without one\n   * people who “use their strengths daily in meaningful ways” are 3.6x more likely to describe their lives as “thriving.”\n   * 70% of people who say they “live their purpose at work” reported being engaged and satisfied, versus only 15% of those without purpose\n   * entrepreneurs with high-purpose founders report 34% higher well-being scores\n   * you get the point\n* **avoid wasting life on things that don't matter**\n   * people who intentionally design their days (clear priorities, aligned actions) report 3.5x higher life satisfaction\n   * time spent in flow states (deep work, creativity, meaningful play) correlates strongly with long-term happiness\n   * people who watch 3+ hours of TV/day report the lowest overall life satisfaction scores among all leisure activities measured\n   * watching >2 hrs/day is linked to a 23% higher risk of depression and lower perceived life meaning\n   * people who identified as very happy watched 30% less TV than those who reported being unhappy\n   * people who spend 3+ hours/day on social media report 60% higher rates of anxiety and depression\n   * limiting social media use to ≤30 minutes/day led to significant improvements in life satisfaction, sleep, and overall well-being within just 3 weeks\n   * passive scrolling (consuming without engaging) correlates with 22% lower self-esteem and 28% higher regret afterward\n   * people in the top 10% of social media usage are twice as likely to report feeling “dissatisfied with their time use\n   * people who spend most free time in passive leisure (TV, social media, aimless browsing) score 23% lower on life satisfaction than those engaged in active leisure (exercise, hobbies, learning, socializing)\n   * people who reflect on their daily activities show 40% more regret when they spent large chunks of time passively consuming vs. doing meaningful activities\n\n# Relationships\n\n* **have at least 1-3 supportive relationships**\n   * people with strong relationships lived up to 12 years longer on average\n   * loneliness increases the risk of early death as much as smoking 15 cigarettes per day\n   * positive relationships correlate with lower cortisol levels and reduced systemic inflammation, key markers for healthy aging\n   * social isolation increases the risk of premature death by 29% and dementia by 50%\n   * people who self-identified as lonely were 2.5x more likely to experience depression and anxiety disorders\n   * people with strong social ties scored 4x higher on life satisfaction than those without, regardless of income level\n   * quality relationships have 3x more impact on life satisfaction than earning more money\n   * people who reported having 3+ close friends were 96% more likely to describe their life as thriving\n   * perceived social rejection activates the same brain regions as physical pain which means poor relationships literally hurt\n   * people with supportive partners showed 40% stronger immune responses to common colds\n   * happily partnered individuals have lower blood pressure, better heart health, and fewer chronic diseases\n* **have 0 toxic relationships**\n   * toxic relationships are worse for your health than no relationships\n   * chronic exposure to pessimism and criticism rewires your brain for threat detection, increasing anxiety and lowering emotional resilience\n   * people in high-conflict marriages had a 34% higher risk of heart disease vs. those in low-conflict marriages\n   * people in high-conflict, high-stress jobs are 50% more likely to experience burnout and 23% more likely to develop depression\n* **be part of a community**\n   * feeling connected to where you live boosts happiness scores 2.3x\n\n# Health\n\n* **sleep at least 6 hours / night**\n   * people who consistently sleep <6 hours/night have a 33% higher risk of death from all causes\n   * chronic short sleep (<6 hrs) raises risk of heart disease by 48% and stroke by 15%\n   * if you get more than 6 hrs of sleep you'll have\n      * 23% lower risk of depression\n      * 34% better memory retention\n      * 2.2x higher life satisfaction vs. <6 hrs\n* **move your body for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week**\n   * exercise is the single most powerful predictor of long-term health\n   * just 11 minutes/day of brisk walking reduces risk of early death by 23%\n* **eat healthy**\n   * people with the highest diet quality scores lived 12-14 years longer on average than those with the lowest\n   * eat at least 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day\n      * ≥5 servings fruits/veggies per day = 31% lower mortality risk\n   * keep ultra-processed foods less than 50% of your calorie intake\n      * ultra-processed foods (>50% calories) = 62% higher risk of metabolic syndrome\n   * keep processed sugar less than 25% of your calorie intake\n      * added sugars >25% calories/day = 2x higher likelihood of obesity and diabetes\n* **treat chronic diseases**\n   * people who manage chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes\n      * live 6-8 years longer on average\n      * report 25% higher self-rated well-being\n* **manage mental health**\n   * high chronic stress levels shorten telomeres, accelerating cellular aging by up to 10 years\n   * regular mindfulness practices like meditation, breathing, and journaling lead to\n      * 43% lower rates of depressive relapse\n      * 32% lower systemic inflammation markers\n* **avoid addiction**\n   * substance\n      * alcohols cut their life expectancy by 10-15 years\n      * smoker shorten their lifespan by 10 years on average\n      * drug addicts have a strong correlation with chronic anxiety, poor sleep, and reduced cognitive performance\n   * behavioral\n      * people who spend >3 hrs/day on social platforms report 60% higher rates of anxiety and depression\n      * porn addiction is associated with lower relationship satisfaction, impaired motivation, and reward system desensitization\n      * gambling & dopamine loop overactivation of reward pathways leads to reduced baseline happiness and more compulsive behavior\n\n# Finances\n\n* **make at least $40k / year in the US**\n   * obvi different if you're in big cities like NY or Miami etc.\n   * people making <$40k report 2.7x higher daily stress and 50% lower life satisfaction\n* **have at least 3 months of emergency savings**\n

      "body": "I used to think I was depressed. Turns out, I was just comfortable being miserable.\n\nLike most of you, I fell down the self-improvement rabbit hole. You name it, I tried it:\n\n* 4am cold showers (lasted 3 days)\n* $200 on meditation apps I never opened\n* Every YouTube guru's \"morning routine\"\n* Journaling (my notebook has 2 entries)\n* Those motivational IG pages that post wolves\n\nNone of it stuck because I was lying to myself. I wasn't actually trying to improve - I was trying to feel better about not improving.\n\nThen I found stoicism through some random YouTube video. Started with Meditations (didn't understand half of it lol). But something clicked. These weren't some 20-year-old tiktokers telling me to \"rise and grind\" - these were emperors and slaves who actually lived this shit.\n\nThe harsh truth? I wasn't failing because of circumstances. I was failing because:\n\n1. I blamed everything except myself\n2. I thought watching motivation videos = taking action\n3. I was addicted to comfort while pretending to want growth\n\nReal change started when I stopped looking for inspiration and started facing reality. Been diving deeper into stoicism lately (Marcus Aurelius on a Stoic Chat app roasted my victim mentality at 2AM last week lmao). But the biggest shift happened when I finally accepted that:\n\n* Motivation is bullshit. You either do it or you don't\n* Your environment shapes you. I deleted social media, cut toxic friends\n* Comfort is the enemy. If it doesn't make you uncomfortable, it's not growth\n* You know what to do. You're just avoiding it\n\n6 months later:\n\n* Got my first real job\n* Started actually going to the gym (not just buying gym clothes)\n* Having real conversations instead of avoiding conflict\n* Actually reading books instead of saving \"how to read more\" videos\n\nStop lying to yourself. You're not stuck - you're hiding.",

      "title": "habits in your 20's that make life WAY easier later on?",
      "body": "I’m turning 31 this year, and I’ve been reflecting on some of the things I did in my 20s that made my life easier. My life today is far from easy, but my problems would be much worse if I hadn’t learned these habits sooner.\n\nDeveloping just one of these habits in your 20s will make your life SO much easier later on:\n\n1. _Reading._ When I was in my early 20s, I developed a reading habit. The more I read, the more ambitious I became. I felt a lot more confident learning things that most people didn’t take the time to learn, and reading stories of people accomplishing great things made me believe I could do it too. If you learn to love reading, you can teach yourself pretty much anything.\n\n2. _Staying active._ Running consistently and joining a boxing gym were some of the best things I did for my mental health. You’ll build confidence, become more resilient to stress and depression, and develop discipline that carries over into every area of your life.\n\n3. _Avoiding FOMO._ I once deleted all my social media accounts for two years to focus on myself and my goals. Keeping up with friends is important, but sometimes, it’s better to take a break from living life online. Your real friends will always be there, no matter how disconnected you are from social media. Avoiding the need to keep up with people—especially online—will help you stay focused. Your journey is unique, and your only competition is yourself.\n\n4. _Living below your means._ I bought a used 2006 car in 2016 for $6,700 (paid in cash with money I saved from waiting tables), and I still have it today. I kept the same iPhone and laptop for 5+ years and kept my expenses to an absolute minimum. Having the money to buy what you want whenever you want is infinitely better than actually buying stuff.\n\n5. _Prioritizing saving & investing._ Open a Roth IRA and start investing in low-cost index funds/ETFs today. I now have over $100K invested—if I had started sooner in my 20s, I’d probably have triple that. Having money work for you while you sleep and knowing your financial future is secure eliminates so much unnecessary stress, allowing you to be more present and enjoy life.\n\n6. _Taking risks._ It gets significantly harder to take risks as you get older and take on more responsibilities. Your 20s are the time to go after your dreams, make mistakes, and learn from them. You won’t regret failing—you’ll regret not trying. I started an e-commerce business on the side while waiting tables, and that business later became my full-time income. It only lasted 2.5 years, and I made pretty much every mistake possible, but I learned a lot, and I don’t regret it.\n\nThis isn’t to say you can’t develop these habits later in life—it’s never too late.\n\nWhat habits would you add?",

Minimize screen time and social media and be selective with what you allow into your mind. Take time to reflect, meditate and disconnect from all external input for some time daily.\n\n\\- To counteract physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle, you gotta exercise on a daily basis. Frequency is more important than intensity. Also, do something to maintain a good posture. It's crucial for feeling your best.\n\n\\- To counteract overeating, practice contentment in everything you do. Be selective of what you put into your body.

      "body": "A few years ago, I hit rock bottom. My business failed. I had no money, no job, and no idea what I was doing with my life. My bank account was nearly empty. I had to borrow money for rent. My relationship was not in a good place. I couldn’t fall asleep at night and some nights I had panic attacks.\n\nI felt embarrassed and ashamed. I had nothing to show for all the effort I put in. I saw all my friends surpass me in their career. I wanted to fix things, but I didn’t know where to start. I was mentally and emotionally drained.\n\nEven though I am not where I want to be in life, I am in a much better place. I just released my second book. I work for a tech company where I am one of the top performers in the department. I have been consistent in the gym. My relationship is great.\n\nHere’s what helped me start pulling myself out. These aren't magic solutions, but they gave me structure when I had none.\n\n1. Going to the gym: Moving my body helped me get out of my head. It gave me a small win every day. As I saw results in my body, I slowly built up my confidence again.\n\n2. I found stable income: I applied to jobs everyday and in the meantime I drove Uber. Having some steady money coming in reduced the stress. It gave me space to breathe and plan.\n\n3. I sat in silence every day: No phone, no music, no distractions. Just sat. It helped me connect with myself and hear what I was actually feeling underneath the noise.\n\n4. I learned from someone who’s already where you want to be: I stopped trying to figure everything out alone. I found mentors through books, podcasts, YouTube, and courses. Their structure gave me direction to release a couple of books, get paid to speak, and land a job in tech.\n\n5. I spent 1 hour a day on my goals outside of work: No matter how chaotic the day was, I made that hour non-negotiable. That consistency added up and became the thing that moved me forward the most.\n\nThese steps didn’t instantly fix my life, but they gave me enough traction to start rebuilding. \n\nIf you’re in a dark place right now, start small. \n\nPick one of these and commit to it. You don’t have to have it all figured out. Just take the next step.\n\nYou’re not alone. Keep going.",

      "body": "So we all know our phones are rotting our brains. Saw this study from Heidelberg University that said your brain can start to rewire itself after just three days of reduced phone usage. Not 21 days. Not 90. Just 3.  \n\nThat number kind of stuck with me. Felt do-able. \n\nI didn’t delete my apps or anything. Just blocked access to the stuff I usually open on autopilot, Reddit, Insta, news, etc. and only allowed 4 unblocks per day. After 3 days I actually didn’t want to go back to my previous baseline. \n\nAfter day 3, I kept going. I was sleeping better. Felt less scatterbrained. I actually reached for a book for the first time in forever. I started doing walks after dinner instead of scrolling. And I noticed this little shift in how present I felt, like I wasn’t constantly buzzing in the background. It was like a snowball effect, once I started I kept finding more times in the day I could replace with better things. \n\nHere’s how I did it:\n\n* Used an app blocker so I had to be intentional about when I did use my phone\n* Kept my phone in another room at night\n* Picked a couple things to replace the scroll (books, long showers, walks, journaling)\n* Told myself I only had to make it 3 days\n\nThat tiny window made it way more approachable. I’m two weeks in now, and still going strong. It’s not like I don’t use my phone at all, I still average like 45mins to 1hour on social but it’s much less obsessive.\n\nHighly recommend trying it if you’re stuck in a scroll spiral.",

      "body": "**Everything is Temporary:** \n\nWhen I was in prison, it felt like I would be there forever. That my permanent state of being was uncertainty and pain. I felt as though I would be worthless for the remainder of my life.  Once I looked beyond the fear and anxiety, I understood there was an expiration date. I didn't know when, but I knew there was one. That alone gave me the strength to endure.  This is the power of impermanence.\n\n**Our Perspective Dictates our Reality:**  \n\nIs this happening to you? Is this happening for you? One is playing the victim, the other is taking responsibility for your life. The moment I dropped the victim role (which I played for a while), I found freedom - inside prison. This is our choice.\n\n**Choice is Freedom:** \n\nI found \"Man's Search for Meaning\" in the prison library. It's one of the most profound perspective shifting books I have ever read. I reread it once a year. This quote is one of many reasons I make that claim. \n\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nWhen we embrace choice, we have agency over our lives.  When we have agency over our lives - we can rebuild. We can start over. \n\n**Gratitude is a Superpower:** \n\nI was sitting in the prison library, with nothing to my name. I lost everything. My amazing wife, my career, my money, my homes, and cars. I lost my identity and self-worth. And yet, one crisp early morning, the sunrise was spectacular. I put pen to paper and wrote, \"I'm grateful for this morning's sunrise.\" \n\nI found something to be grateful for in my most challenging time. I cannot express how important that truly is. \n\n**Adversity Can Be a Gift:** \n\nOur greatest adversities do not have to be the end. In fact, they can be our greatest teachers and our greatest beginnings. The choice is ours. It begins when we embrace the other 4 lessons.",

      "body": "This sounds insane but hear me out...\nSo 2 years ago I was a typical underachieving college student. 2.3 GPA, couldn't bench my bodyweight, zero discipline. I tried all the usual shit , motivation videos, goal setting, accountability partners. Nothing stuck because I was operating from the wrong identity.\n\n\nI first stumbled across this concept while reading about cognitive biases, but it really clicked when I came across research on the brain’s predictive processing in\nJames Clear’s “Atomic Habits” . The lightbulb moment was realizing that what psychologists call ‘confirmation bias’ and what neuroscientists call ‘predictive coding’ were describing the same fundamental mechanism, and that this mechanism could be deliberately redirected.\n\nYour brain is wired to be a prediction machine, it constantly looks for information that confirms what it already believes. This is what we call Confirmation bias, it is the process where your mind seeks out information that supports your existing beliefs and ignores or downplays anything that contradicts them.\n\nIf you think you’re a loser, your brain will find evidence of that. But here’s where it gets interesting, this same mechanism can also be used the other way around. If you believe you’re successful, the same mechanism will look for proof of your success.\n\nThe key insight is that your subconscious mind can’t tell the difference between what’s real and what’s vividly imagined. Basic neuroscience. Your brain processes imagined scenarios using many of the same neural pathways as real experiences.\n\nThe trick is starting ridiculously small. Your brain won’t buy “actually, I’m a fitness god” when you can barely do 10 pushups. But it will accept “I’m someone who works out” after you do literally 5 minutes of exercise.\n\nI created what I call “identity anchors” , small daily actions that proved my new identity to myself:\n\n•Successful students go to the library → I went to the library (even if just for 20 minutes)\n\n•Disciplined people make their beds → I made my bed every morning\n\n•Strong people lift weights → I did bodyweight exercises for 10 minutes\n\nInstead of trying to motivate my lazy self to work harder, I started collecting evidence that I was actually someone who had always been disciplinary but just hadn’t realized it yet. I’d find tiny examples, like that time I finished a video game completely, or how I never missed my favorite TV show. My brain started pattern-matching: “Oh, so I actually AM someone who follows through on things I care about.”\n\nEach small completion became data points proving I was “the type of person who follows through.” My brain couldn’t argue with the evidence.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I realized I could accelerate this process by controlling my information diet. I stopped consuming content about struggling, failing, or being mediocre. Instead, I exclusively consumed books, podcasts, and videos by people who had the identity I wanted.\n\nWithin two years, I had a 3.8 GPA and could bench 1.5x my bodyweight. Not because I forced myself to change, but because I had successfully convinced my own brain that I actually already was the type of person who achieved these things.\n\nYour brain is a prediction machine that creates reality based on your stories. When you start to genuinely BELIEVE that you're destined for success so hard that you can't differentiate it from reality anymore, your neural pathways rewire to support that identity. Your brain starts scanning for opportunities that match your self-image instead of evidence of limitations.\n\nTraditional self-help fails for lots of people because it tries to fight against these deep-seated neural patterns with willpower alone. But if you can actually shift the underlying identity, the core beliefs your brain uses as its search parameters, then the same confirmation bias that was working against you starts working for you.",

      "title": "10 Years of Marriage: Lessons I Wish I'd Known from the Start",
      "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter a 10-year marriage that ultimately ended in divorce, I found myself reflecting on the entire journey—what went right, what went wrong, and all the lessons that could have made a difference. I spoke with a few people, both men and women, and it hit me: many people are searching for a spouse but may not fully understand the depth of what marriage truly is.\n\nI’m sharing my experiences here, not to discourage anyone but to shed light on what I wish I’d known. Hopefully, these insights will be helpful to anyone seriously considering marriage or looking to strengthen their current relationship.\n\n**1. Intentions Matter More Than We Realize**\n\nWhen I first got married, I thought love alone would carry us through anything. But over the years, I realized that the foundation of a relationship isn’t just emotions; it’s intentions. Having clear, shared intentions from the beginning what we both wanted from life, our values, our commitment to support each other would have helped us steer through the tougher times. Start your marriage with sincerity and know why you’re committing to each other.\n\n**2. Don’t Overlook Small Acts of Kindness**\n\nIt’s easy to assume that grand gestures will keep the spark alive, but I found that small, consistent acts of kindness build a stronger bond over time. A gentle word, a little patience, or even just a smile after a long day speaks volumes. The daily, quiet kindnesses we often overlook are the glue that holds everything together. Over time, I think we forgot this, focusing too much on what wasn’t working rather than nurturing each other in small ways.\n\n**3. Communication is Hard, But it’s the Backbone**\n\nPeople say “communicate” all the time, but let’s be real—it’s not as easy as it sounds. For years, I didn’t know how to express my feelings without holding back or without frustration. We had different communication styles, which sometimes made us feel worlds apart. I learned that communication is a skill you work on continuously. It means being honest, patient, and humble enough to listen without ego. If I had practiced this earlier, maybe we could’ve navigated conflicts better.\n\n**4. Value Growth in Yourself and Each Other**\n\nOne of my biggest regrets is that we didn’t focus on growing together as individuals. Marriage should be a journey where you’re both evolving, learning, and pushing each other towards personal betterment. I learned too late that a healthy marriage is one where each person is supportive of the other’s growth not threatened by it. If you see your partner growing, encourage them. Celebrate their wins, and let them do the same for you.\n\n**5. Don’t Carry Resentments; Address Them Early**\n\nOver time, small grievances and unspoken feelings can turn into resentment. I let issues pile up, hoping they’d resolve on their own, but they rarely do. When you let them fester, they turn into silent barriers. Now I know that when something bothers you, you need to bring it up respectfully and work through it together. An open heart, no matter how difficult the conversation, will save you so much pain down the line.\n\n**6. Understand That It’s Not Always About Winning**\n\nLooking back, I wish I had focused less on being “right” and more on understanding my partner’s perspective. Sometimes, in the heat of disagreements, I felt the need to prove my point, and it drove a wedge between us. Remember that you and your spouse are on the same team. There’s no winning if it comes at the cost of peace in your relationship.\n\n**7. Patience and Forgiveness Are Your Best Friends**\n\nMarriage is full of moments where you’ll need patience and forgiveness. There were times when I was quick to point out flaws and mistakes, but rarely stopped to think about the effect of my words. Learning to forgive genuinely—not holding grudges—is key to a peaceful relationship. Forgiveness doesn’t mean ignoring what hurt you; it means choosing to move forward without bitterness.\n\n**8. Remember That Faith is a Guiding Light**\n\nThroughout my journey, the principles of patience, compassion, and mutual respect kept me grounded. Whether it was enduring hardships, finding compassion during disagreements, or simply reminding myself of the blessings we shared, my faith reminded me of a bigger picture. Leaning on these values, even in the hardest times, gave me peace and perspective.\n\n**My Takeaway**\n\nWhile my marriage ultimately ended, I carry these lessons with me. I hope sharing them can help anyone else out there trying to build or sustain a marriage. Every relationship has its ups and downs, and none of us are perfect, but we can always learn from each other.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’d say to anyone getting married or working through marital challenges, it’s this: cherish and respect each other, forgive easily, and grow together. Because even if things don’t work out in the end, at least you’ll know you did your best.",

She said she will think about it.\n\nDont think I will hear from her but I never done this before. And I am proud of myself.\nBeing introverted this took alot of courage.🤭\n\nAnd yes.

      "body": "**Distinguishing the key differences between Nice Guys and genuinely good men.**\n\nIn this world, there is a subset of men that believe women are only attracted to assholes.\n\nWhich is true, if you preface this belief with 'very few'.\n\nThe vast majority of women are attracted to good men.\n\nThe subset of men that believe otherwise are Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a Nice Guy?\n\n## Nice Guy: (noun)\n\nA man that displays overwhelming acts of kindness towards women, with a firm expectation of immediate romantic or sexual rewards.\n\nSome of the common traits of a Nice Guy include:\n\n## He puts women on a pedestal\n\nNice guys are prone to putting women on a pedestal. They do so to the point of making a woman uncomfortable, or worse, bored.\n\nThey will 'coincidentally' have all of the same hobbies and interests as her.\n\nThey will agree with all of her world views and personal opinions.\n\nThey refuse to say anything that could offend her (up until the point she rejects him, but we'll get to that in a moment).\n\nThey are at her beck and call whether or not she becks or calls for it. \n\nThey constantly fawn over her.\n\nThey laugh too loudly at her throwaway jokes.\n\nThey drown her in unnecessary flattery.\n\n## He's dishonest\n\nNice Guy's are dishonest by nature.\n\nThey pretend to agree with everything a woman says.\n\nThey deceive women through the use of emotional manipulation.\n\nThey falsely big-note themselves to women.\n\nThey literally tell women: 'I'm a good guy'.\n\nNice Guys are dishonest.\n\n## Being a sore loser\n\nWhen a nice guy faces rejection from a woman, his response generally involves a two-step approach:\n\n## 1. He initially ignores it.\n\nA Nice Guy will relentlessly continue his pursuit of a woman, despite any subtle, initial signals she gives off that she's not interested.\n\nAs such, women are eventually pushed to the point of forcefully spelling it out to him: 'I'M NOT INTERESTED, LEAVE ME ALONE'.\n\n## 2. He throws a tantrum\n\nOnce a Nice Guy realises defeat, he doesn't keep his cool and move on from the rejection with grace and civility.\n\nHe burns the bridge between him and her until there is nothing left but the charred remains of his bruised ego.\n\nHe calls her a prude or a slut (or sometimes both, unaware of the irony).\n\nHe makes nasty comments about her personal appearance.\n\nFinally,then he caps it off with something along the lines of: 'I'm out of your league anyway.'\n\nHere is an example of how this could play out in an online dating scenario:\n\nNice Guy: Hello Emily, you have beautiful eyes.I should tell you, I'm not like most guys.I know how to treat a girl right. If you go out with me, I'll be the one in the kitchen making YOU a sandwich! Hehe...\n\n**Emily: Hey, thanks for the compliment.**\n\n**Nice Guy: You're welcome.So, what sort of sandwich can I come over and make for you tonight?**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Hello?**\n\n**Emily: Hey, sorry, I'm at work.I appreciate the offer, but I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not really ready to meet up with any guys just yet.** **Nice Guy: Well that's good, cos I'm not just any guy. Hehe.How about we take it slow then. Let me take you out for a coffee.**\n\n**Emily: As I said, I'm not ready for that yet.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Come on, I promise I'm a good guy.**\n\n**Emily: Look, I'm not interested, ok? Sorry.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Ok, fine. Jeez. Just trying to be nice.**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: I bet you'll end up dating some jobless loser who treats you like shit.** \n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\nNice Guy: **No wonder your last boyfriend left you.Women only date asshole losers. If you don't want to meet any guys, then why the fuck are you on this app in the first place?**\n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Fine, don't respond. Slut.**\n\nThis sort of interaction begs the question: If women are only attracted to assholes, why aren't they swooning over Nice Guys? Because they mostly don't.\n\n## He has no respect for women\n\nDeep down, Nice Guys have no respect for women. \n\nThis is apparent when you witness the Jekyll to Hyde transformation a Nice Guy makes whenever a woman rejects him.\n\nIt is also apparent with the overwhelming approach Nice Guys take to their pursuit of a woman.\n\nMen who respect women don't check in on them every ten minutes, nor do they leave women banks of 4 unresponded text messages on the regular. \n\nThis sort of behaviour is invasive, uncomfortable and ultimately, disrespectful.\n\n## He's completely unaware of himself\n\nNice Guys seldom accept fault when a woman rejects them.\n\nThey refuse to consider: 'If I keep sending women uncomfortably flattering messages and not a single one of them responds positively, maybe that's on me?'\n\nInstead, a Nice Guy carries on recycling the same tired, empty messages, growing more resentful with each rejection he receives in response.\n\nA Nice Guy's inability to self-reflect and self-improve condemns him to a life of bitter cynicism and exponentially painful rejection.\n\n## Are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?\n\nNow that you've read through some of the typical traits of a Nice Guy, you're probably wondering: 'are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?'\n\nWhile many Nice Guys have always been selfish, cynical pricks, not all of them were born this way. Some are newly Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a newly Nice Guy?\n\nNewly Nice Guys are those that began their dating life as insecure, misguided young men and devolved into Nice Guys over time.\n\nLet me show you an example of how this happens.\n\nIn this example, I'll call our pre-Nice Guy, Guy.\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a woman.***\n\n***He is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and confused as to why she rejected him. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a new woman.***\n\n***Just like last time, he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and even more confused as to why it happened. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\nAs this pattern continues, Guy becomes a little more cynical and a little more frustrated each time.\n\nEver heard of the saying: The definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?\n\nWell, that's spot on in the case of how some men become newly Nice Guys, and how Nice Guys stay Nice Guys.\n\nThey continue the same lazy, ill-conceived attempts at seduction over and over, expecting someone will eventually take the bait.\n\nAs the rejections pile up, they develop a resentment towards women, become sore-losers and convince themselves into believing that the only reason women don't like them, is because women are only attracted to assholes.\n\n## Let's talk about good men\n\nNice Guys and good men are polar opposites.\n\nWhile a Nice Guy is disrespectful, insincere, overly agreeable and selfish, a good man is respectful, confident, honest and selfless.\n\nSome of the common traits of a good man include:\n\n## He carries out acts of kindness with no ulterior motive\n\nGood men don't hold the door open for women or compliment their smiles, as a way to get her into bed.\n\nA good man displays acts of kindness towards women because being kind and respectful is in his nature.\n\nWomen appreciate acts of kindness when they sense that it's being delivered in a sincere, ulterior free manner.\n\nSincere gestures from a man lower a woman's defences and increase his credibility in her eyes.\n\n## He treats women as individuals\n\nUnlike Nice Guys, (who let their negative experiences with a few women dictate their views on all women) a good man treats women on a case by case basis.\n\nThis is beneficial, regardless of the outcome of his past encounters with women.\n\nWhen a past encounter was negative, he doesn't project his baggage onto the next woman.\n\nWhen a past encounter was positive, he doesn't set unrealistically high expectations upon the next woman.\n\n## He's a good loser\n\nWhen a good man gets rejected by a girl, (yes, it does happen) no matter how painful it feels, he knows when to call it quits, accept the loss and move on.\n\nHe won't respond to her rejection message demanding she explains herself further.\n\nHe won't accuse her of disliking him because he treated her too well.\n\nHe won't send her insulting messages until she elicits an emotional response.\n\nHe's too busy getting back on his feet and finding somebody else.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The recovery time from a break-up is dependent on the length and nature of the relationship. I'm not suggesting good men move on from every rejection quickly and effortlessly.*\n\n## He doesn't dote on women\n\nGood men are rarely accused of appearing desperate in their pursuit of a woman.  This is namely because a good man won't dote on a woman.\n\nBefore he compliments her, he senses that the situation calls for it.\n\nHe won't show strong affection towards a woman until he feels the relationship has developed to the point where his affection will be well received and reciprocated.\n\nHe doesn't treat women like poor, lost puppies, as he sees them as adults who are capable of looking after themselves.\n\n## He is always looking for ways to improve\n\nGood men are naturally self-reflective beings.\n\nWhen a good man realises his shortcomings or is faced with rejection, he makes a concerted effort to confront his shortcomings and improve himself.\n\nThis is vastly different from Nice Guys, who prefer to blame their problems on everyone else.\n\n## He challenges women\n\nGood men won't enthusiastically agree with everything a woman says and does. If he disagrees with something she's said, he will make it known, respectfully.\n\nGood men also aren't afraid to make fun of a woman (in a fun and playful way). \n\nExamples of this include: 'I'd ask you to dance, but you couldn't handle my moves' or 'I don't think you and I are going to work out, we should call it quits now' (after she reveals she doesn't like Nando's)\n\n## He is self-assured\n\nGood men know their worth and remind themselves of it often.\n\nThey won't bend at the will of others or let 'haters' alter the views they have of themselves.\n\nThey hold strong to their values and express them with women in a mature are rational manner.\n\n## He respects women\n\nGood men view women as their peers.\n\nBy treating women as their peers (which, in fairness, all men rightfully should), good men reap 2 benefits:\n\n1. They don't run the risk of becoming subservient to a woman.\n2. They don't view women as inferior by expecting immediate gratification for their attempts at seduction (therefore their expectations aren't constantly crushed, leading them down a hateful emotional spiral ala Nice Guys.)\n\n## He owns his insecurities\n\nBeing a good man doesn't mean being free from insecurities.\n\nSure, the average good man has far fewer insecurities than the average Nice Guy, but still - he does have them.\n\nThe difference is, he's not afraid to admit them.\n\nWhere a Nice Guy will channel his insecurities into bullying others and bringing them down, a good man owns his insecurities and looks to address them in a healthy manner.\n\nThe way a good man owns his insecurities is by:\n\n\\- Being open about them and seeking counsel from friends on them\n\n\\- Considering ways he can alleviate his insecurities by improving himself\n\n\\- Developing strong empathy and understanding for the insecurities of others, based on those he sees in himself\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nWhile the traits listed above provide an underlying framework of what makes a Nice Guy vs. what makes a good man, the world is not so black and white.\n\nSome good guys have moments of weakness, just as some Nice Guys have moments of clarity and good.\n\nIf you are guilty of a few Nice Guy traits and you fear you could become a full blown Nice Guy, please know - there's still a chance for salvation.\n\nMy advice to you is to change your mindset and attitude towards women, but firstly - towards yourself.\n\nIf you don't,  you are likely to live a life filled with romantic rejection and increasing bitterness towards yourself and others.\n\nNice Guys, start being good men.\n\nGood men, keep up the good work.",

Make a healthy lifestyle (especially eating)\n3. Enforce sleeping rules (If you are having sleeping issues, investigate asap.)\n\n**Healthy Lifestyles:**\n\n1. Floss. Nothing makes you feel like you have your life as put together, then flossing. You can buy the stick applicators that are way better. If you're doing that, you may as well get mouthwash.\n2. If you're flossing and doing mouthwash, may as well wear your retainer.\n3. Make your bed everyday.\n4. Buy a tool to measure your personal activity (an app, fitness watch, etc.)- wear it constantly.\n5. For those sleep deprived: blackout curtains, ear plugs, satin pillows, weighted blankets, stuffed animals, white noise, asmr, no technology 1 hour before bed, reading before bed or natural supplements can help a lot. If you're getting tired after you're eating: this is often a symptom of a food allergy, food insensitivity or overindulgence.\n6. Make a skincare routine.\n7. Buy new socks and underwear.\n8. Put a counsellor/psychologist on your yearly checkup list\n\n**Career/Income/Growth:**\n\n1. Have an income\n2. Make a huge goal within reasonable limits (huge goal does not mean being a CEO- it's what's meaningful to *you).*\n3. Make smaller goals to get there\n4. Make smaller goals for you to personally enjoy\n5. Write down the things that would impress you, if you achieved. Pin it physically to a board.\n6. Get a whiteboard/corkboard or something you can physically see items written down everyday\n7. Mentioned above, make a plan for your income. Even if its 1$ saved a week- that's still 365$\n\n**Emotional/Mental Wellbeing:**\n\n1. Get your phone out and put your loved ones birthday in your calendars. Add important events.\n2. Add in your phone a once a month reminder to check in with loved ones to see how they're doing\n3. In that calendar, make a note if one of your friends is going through a hard time, set a reminder to check in on them.\n4. Figure out what you want in life, especially dating. If you don't figure out what you want, you make yourself vulnerable to being used or being misguided.\n5. Identify (or try) your Achilles heel. What are you bad at? Just keep this in mind for later development.\n\n**Overnight Change:**\n\n1. Donate the pieces in your wardrobe that aren't you anymore. Start getting pieces that are. Think about where those items are also coming from; consider secondhand.\n2. Start reading, get a bookshelf and begin to fill it with things you love.\n3. Do what you want with your appearance as long as it's in alignment with your goals/vision for yourself.\n4. Volunteer even if its just 3-4 hours a week. Retirement homes and aging populations, are some of the most valuable connections you can have.\n5. Go to the gym, watch what you eat, do all the advice reddit prescribes.\n6. Go out of your way to teach someone something, even if its just a tutorial. This will help you grow confidence in your own knowledge, sharpen communication and help connect to others.\n\n**Checkbox Lists That Will Start To Change Your Day:**\n\n1. The 15 things you are afraid of list. Great, now go do most of them.\n2. The 3 things you should have done but ignored, list. Great, now go do them.\n3. The 3 things you wanted to do this year but haven't got around too (make sure they're fun).\n4. Not a checkbox: The last 4 years of bad decisions you made and beside them, why you made it. Sit with that uncomfortable feeling for awhile and accept responsibility. If you do not learn, the universe will try to teach you again.\n5. When you're done with those lists, print out a monthly calender and jot down some important things you need to do. After you do that for awhile, make a weekly to-do list, eventually a daily one should result. Checkboxes are your friend and give you dopamine.\n\n**Things I Had To Learn The Hard Way (that I hope you'll avoid to make this world a better place)**\n\n1. Always attend the wake and/or funeral. People die once. Stop being selfish and think of others. You will never regret going.\n2. Give more than you take.\n3. When you fail to make a decision, the universe will make it for you. It may be the wrong one, still. When you are too indecisive and finally make a decision last minute, the weight of that decision will often come back to you, like a slap in the face. It's okay to be wrong and make mistakes.\n4. Hold yourself to a high standard and if no one is telling you that you can do better, I am.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Common Bad Habits**:\n\n1. Unplug preferably from social media. If not, limit to 30 minutes.\n2. Quit ideally daydreaming, moreso when you have other things you should do or work towards\n3. Stop applying all your time to something that has little feedback (videogames- add another hobby)\n4. Stop staying up late at night\n5. Quit feeling sorry for yourself and if you can't stop (we've all been there), go listen to someone else for awhile.\n6. Failing to think/check in/consider other people on a frequent basis\n7. Running away from your problems through travelling, instagram, netflix, drugs, booze, dating etc. Stop turning your brain off all the time. You have good ideas up there.\n8. Monitor your recreation\n9. Being bad with finances (this is not the same as poverty)\n10. Comparing yourself to others.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Small Things That Will Pay Off**:\n\n1. Go learn basic history- especially go learn basic history of the last 75 years\n2. Have a basic knowledge of finances, housekeeping, driving, changing tires, etc.\n3. Have a basic knowledge of common mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, bipolar, narcissism etc.)\n4. Ask your parents things you wanted to know; record a message from them, even if its something small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the pms, comments and awards. Hope this helps you. Made this list while just checking over things in my own life. It's not about implementing every single one but slowly integrating these into your daily life. Motivation is a poor mans discipline.",

I felt guilty, lazy, and frustrated, thinking meditation was a test I kept failing.\n\nThen one day, my therapist told me something that flipped everything: meditation isn’t about stopping thoughts, it’s about noticing them without getting attached.\n\nSo I tried it differently. Instead of fighting my thoughts, I let them float by like clouds. Instead of judging myself for thinking, I observed. And something crazy happened: my anxiety started shrinking. My focus got sharper. My emotions stopped controlling me the way they used to.\n\nIt turns out all those years I thought I was doing it wrong, I was just doing it with the wrong goal. The hack nobody tells you is that meditation is training your awareness, not silencing your brain.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like meditation is impossible or that you’re failing at self-improvement, try this: stop trying to stop. Start noticing. Start observing. It feels uncomfortable at first but that discomfort is growth whispering in your ear.\n\nThis tiny shift didn’t just improve my mental health. It changed the way I respond to stress, frustration, and even people around me. My life started quietly improving in ways I didn’t anticipate. And the best part? It’s ridiculously simple and free for everyone.\n\nYour brain isn’t broken for thinking too much. You just haven’t learned the real hack yet.",

      "body": "# 5. “Too late” is not exists\n\nIn my early 20s I compared myself to others. I compared my achievements with people my age. And it has got me into a trap. I had the fear to start from the bottom.\n\nIf I’ll start from scratch some “Bob” will be 3 years ahead of me in life quality, finance and achievements.\n\nI couldn’t let it happen so I stayed at a job that I hated. Just to not feel like I was behind someone.\n\nHow did I overcome it? **I stopped comparing myself to others**\n\n# 4. Don’t rely on anyone but yourself\n\nJust remember that no one will save you.\n\nLuck won’t save you.\n\nYour job won’t save you.\n\nThe government won’t save you.\n\n**Only you can change your life.**\n\nConsistent work and ambitions will get you to your goal.\n\n# 3. Don’t afraid to ask\n\nI lost many opportunities in my life because I was afraid to ask.\n\nI was afraid to get rejected. I was afraid of others’ opinions. I was afraid that people would look at me in the wrong way.\n\nI had a lack of courage.\n\nLife lesson that I learned:\n\n**If you don’t ask, the answer is always no.**\n\n# 2. Happiness is inside\n\nIn the early 20s’ I thought that to be happy you need to have a lot of money, a great car and a big house.\n\nI’m literally laughing writing it right now.\n\nWhat I’ve learned is you don’t need to have any material things to be happy.\n\n**Happiness is in your head.**\n\nThe formula is simple:\n\nA deep sense that you on the right path + Be in the moment and do you best = Happiness\n\n# 1. Life is easy\n\nEveryone talks “Life is difficult”. But it’s not.\n\nThe point is that if you think that life is difficult, it will be. If you think that life is simple, then it will be.\n\nWhen I have a weak mindset, my brain labels everything “hard”. Success is “hard”. Make money is “hard”.\n\nBut when I’ve created a superior mindset life becomes “easy”. Magic.\n\nThe life lesson I learned: **Life is easy, you make it hard**",

I thought having impeccable standards was my thing, but it ended up being my biggest blind spot.\n\nThen I stumbled on a strangely helpful piece of advice: *\"Deliberately practice mediocrity, but with total consistency.\"*\n\nYeah, it sounded ridiculous at first. Isn’t being mediocre exactly what we’re all trying to avoid?\n\nBut I tried it anyway. Instead of perfecting things, I deliberately aimed to be just consistently okay. When I exercised, I went for short, average workouts but never skipped. Writing? I set embarrassingly small word-count goals, but met them daily without fail. Even socially, I stopped trying to impress or entertain, just simply showed up, fully present but without performing.\n\nSomething unexpected happened. By aiming for \"just okay,\" I completely eliminated performance anxiety. The pressure vanished overnight, replaced by quiet, steady progress. My workouts became enjoyable. My writing improved effortlessly. People actually enjoyed my company more because I wasn’t performing or seeking validation.\n\nIronically, my results now are far better than when I was desperate to be impressive. Turns out, consistently doing something average is way more powerful than occasionally doing something great.\n\nGive yourself permission to be mediocre. Just do it relentlessly. It’s paradoxically freeing and shockingly effective.",

But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.\n\nIf you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take Baldwin's words to heart - **whatever you may feel in your life is unfixable may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with.** Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.",

I feel like a lot of us let insecurities from our teen years still sway many of our life choices, even if we aren't getting any happiness out of it. After everything I've experienced and learnt from life since that age, I know now that the person I wanted to be back then sucks, and the lifestyle I wanted for myself was superficial, lonely and meaningless. Sure, you can always \"grow up later\" but I believe if it's something you won't be proud to still be doing when you're 30 that doesn't bring some form of meaning to your life, you shouldn't waste your time doing it now. Get a head start on being someone you will be proud of when you're 30, rather than chasing who you wanted to be at 15.\n\nEdit: For anybody over 30 feeling left out, I just wanted to say that 15 and 30 were just ages I randomly chose because I'm in between those ages. You can choose whichever ages apply to you. My point is nobody should feel old, because we shouldn't be looking through the lenses of our younger selves. We should instead be looking through the lenses of our older selves, realising the time we have left and doing what that person would be proud of, regardless of if that's 40, 50, 60, 70 and so on.",

      "title": "How I Finally Got My Life Together After 20 Years of Chaos",
      "body": "# About me:\n\nFor over two decades, I lived a life completely lacking discipline. I was the textbook definition of a mess:\n\n* I’d skip school for weeks or months at a time.\n* I’d spend entire nights binge-watching garbage on the internet, ignoring responsibilities.\n* My grades were abysmal, assignments were always overdue, and I had no focus or direction in life.\n* Add to that an addiction to fast food and endless social media scrolling, and you get a clear picture of someone stuck in a downward spiral.\n\nFast forward to today, and I’m a completely different person.\n\n* I’ve worked as a software engineer at Fortune 500 companies.\n* My academic performance improved drastically.\n* I consistently lift weights, read books, train in martial arts, and work on my business.\n\nHow did this transformation happen? It wasn’t overnight, and it wasn’t by simply “trying harder.”\n\nHere’s what worked for me:\n\n# 1. I Stopped Relying on Willpower\n\nFor years, I thought discipline was all about willpower. You just “decide” to do something, and then you do it—right? Wrong.\n\nI learned that willpower is like a battery—it runs out. Sure, you can force yourself to wake up early, work out, or eat clean for a few days, but eventually, your reserves will deplete, and you’ll revert back to old habits.\n\nHere’s an analogy that helped me understand this:\n\nImagine you’re thrown into a pit with 50 other people, all heavily armed with body armor, rifles, and night vision goggles. You, on the other hand, have nothing but a tiny knife. Your chances of surviving that fight are slim to none.\n\nRelying solely on willpower is like being that person in the pit—it’s an uphill battle you’re almost destined to lose.\n\nSo, I stopped relying on raw willpower and started equipping myself with better tools.\n\n# 2. I Built Systems\n\nThe most important shift I made was creating systems that removed the need for constant decision-making and made discipline automatic.\n\n# System 1: A Routine\n\nI started organizing my day into a routine. Every activity—working out, studying, eating, and even relaxing—had a specific time slot.\n\nWhy does this work?\n\n1. **It removes decision fatigue:** Constantly debating whether to go to the gym, study, or scroll on your phone is mentally exhausting. With a routine, there’s no debate—you just follow the plan.\n2. **It prepares your mind for what’s coming:** If you know you’re hitting the gym in 30 minutes, your brain starts to prepare for it. This makes transitioning into the activity much easier.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Remove barriers to action. For example, if I know I need to study after dinner, I set out my books, clean my desk, and know exactly what I need to tackle beforehand. This eliminates excuses and makes starting much easier.\n\n# System 2: A Rulebook\n\nI also created a personal \"code of conduct\"—rules I don’t break, no matter what. These are based on patterns I noticed in my life. For instance:\n\n* **Rule: No phone for the first 4 hours of the day**. In the past, I’d start my day by checking notifications and scrolling through social media. It seemed harmless but would ruin my focus and fill my mind with chaotic energy. Now, I avoid my phone in the morning, and my days are far more productive and peaceful.\n\nYou can create your own rules based on your triggers. For example, if hanging out with a certain friend always leads to bad habits, consider limiting that interaction. Write down your rules, and stick to them like your life depends on it—because in some ways, it does.\n\n# 3. I Switched from Instant to Delayed Gratification\n\nIn my undisciplined days, my life revolved around instant gratification:\n\n* Hours of video games.\n* Scrolling endlessly on Instagram.\n* Eating fast food and snacking whenever I felt like it.\n\nThese activities gave me a quick dopamine hit, but they came at a cost. I felt unmotivated, unproductive, and unhappy. Worse, I craved more of these fleeting pleasures just to feel a baseline level of satisfaction, which created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I discovered the power of delayed gratification:\n\n* The sense of accomplishment after a workout.\n* The satisfaction of completing a productive work session.\n* The happiness that comes from knowing I made progress toward my goals.\n\nUnlike instant gratification, delayed gratification doesn’t leave you drained or craving more—it leaves you fulfilled. Over time, I found myself craving these long-lasting rewards instead of the quick dopamine hits.\n\n# What I’ve Learned\n\nDiscipline isn’t about brute-forcing your way through life. It’s about creating an environment that supports your goals and adopting systems that make progress inevitable.\n\nIf you’re struggling with discipline, ask yourself:\n\n* Are you relying too much on willpower?\n* Do you have a routine or rules that guide your daily life?\n* Are you chasing fleeting pleasures or long-term fulfillment?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—what strategies have worked for you in building discipline?",

Challenging.\n\nI learned to let things go with this phrase, do the things I don’t feel like doing, and remind myself to thug it out every time I felt like I was going against a goal I had in mind.\n\nIt’s not even motivational, it’s disciplinary. For years I tried so hard to discipline myself into doing what I knew was necessary for me and the people I care about. But now it’s so simple, with this phrase I rewired and required my brain to see a goal and without a second thought, achieve it.\n\nIt’s a peaceful life and I’m genuinely okay now, thanks to the phrase “thug it out”. Who would’ve thought 💀\n\nAnyone who’s struggling right now, you can wake up tomorrow and be a beast. I’m not motivating you, I’m telling you. No one’s born with this, you just flip the switch and replacing the overthinking with “thug it the fuck out bro”\n\nDifferent things work for different people. I just stopped all the unnecessary overthinking and distracted myself with goals. It’s fun. \n\nAnyway I hope you all have a blessed day/night\n❤️",

      "title": "COMPLETE GUIDE TO QUIT PORN FOR GOOD AND IMPROVE YOUR LIFE",
      "body": "This is not written by me, but **I HAD TO** share it with all of you, because **this is not some temporary trick** to achieve 30, 60, 90 days target. It is a **step by step** **guide** for the **complete reboot**, to completely change your approach towards quitting porn and tackle PMO in the right manner.\n\nI've shared it in a few other subs, because I want to reach as many people as possible.\n\nIt is extremely long, but trust me, **it will change your whole perspective of quitting this addiction**. Just read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWritten by - TheUnderdog\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Porn Addiction is Being Severely Underestimated\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I know this?\n\nBecause most people in the community believe that in order to get rid of this addiction, all they have to do is keep trying over and over again, until eventually things will just 'click' and their brains will finally become rebooted.\n\nVery few are treating this as a true addiction. They just see it as a habit they want to break.\n\nThis is evidenced by the stubborness of many, relying purely on willpower for months, only to constantly reset their counters and beat themselves up for not making any progress.\n\nMost people don't realize how incredibly difficult it is to completely remove artificial stimulation (of any kind) for the rest of their lives. We're talking about years and years of brain conditioning here.\n\nWe're dealing with some powerful stuff here, but it is not treated seriously enough, probably because it's widely accepted by society and is not a substance like heroine or cocaine.\n\nI cringe when people relapse, reset their counters, and proclaim \"This is it, I've had enough, I'm going to do it this time\"...\n\nStop kidding yourself.\n\nThis is an addiction that has to be attacked from many different angles. You need a full arsenal of tools and strategies, as well as a proper mindset.\n\nWillpower alone won't do shit.\n\n**Abstinence is NOT Recovery**\n\nWhat people usually try to do is go as many days clean as they can.\n\nThat's all they do.\n\nThat's all their goal.\n\nThey achieve a certain amount of days, then for whatever reason they relapse, so they start over and repeat.\n\n**That is abstaining. That is not recovering.**\n\nIt is extremely common for people to achieve a certain milestone, such as 30, 90, or 100 days, relapse a few days later, and then find themselves unable to get momentum again. They go back to the beginning and they feel like they lost all their progress from their run.\n\nThere is a constant frustration for lack of progress. People are feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, trying the same thing over and over again without success.\n\nThis is because very few are addressing the real roots of their problems. Very few.\n\nEveryone is focused on how many days they have managed and if their symptoms are either present or gone. They judge their progress by measuring dick hardness, spontaneous erections and morning woods.\n\nThey are \"trying to quit porn\" so that they can \"get rid of their ED\".\n\nSo they abstain for as long as they can, hoping that this can cure their symptoms.\n\n**Completely wrong approach.**\n\nIf they don't see ED improvements, they get discouraged.\n\nIf they see ED improvements, then maybe a porn session or two won't hurt, right?\n\nIf there is no woman around, they justify watching a couple of times. After all, they are not having sex anytime soon, so whats the point?\n\nThey delay dating until their ED is cured or they have managed to go 100 days. But they never achieve this in the first place precisely because of this incorrect mentality.\n\nThe same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety, energy levels, motivation, etc.\n\nThey try to quit porn, so that the symptoms can go away, and so they can finally live life.\n\nPeople are focusing on the wrong things.\n\nThey are not changing the way they think.\n\nThey are not changing the way they live.\n\nThey are not changing the way they view sex and women.\n\nThey are just trying not to masturbate, while everything else remains the same.\n\nThat, my friends, is abstinence, not recovery.\n\nThe Foundation of a Proper Reboot\n\n**Porn addiction is not the cause of your shitty life.**\n\nRead that again.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to improve your life when you're having intense porn sessions every single day that drain your energy and make you a zombie. But porn is not the reason your life sucks.\n\nPlease, this is very important to understand, you have to stop blaming porn for your problems.\n\nThis mentality of *life awaits me after recovery* is destructive.\n\nPorn is not the reason you're a procrastinator. Porn is not the reason you're depressed. Porn is not the reason you're lonely. Porn is not the reason you haven't been able to lose weight or gain muscle.\n\n**Porn is the symptom.**\n\nYou watch porn to escape reality. You watch porn to manage your emotions. You watch porn because you're bored, lonely, stressed, depressed, angry, isolated. You watch porn to feel good for a moment, to replace uncomfortable emotions and situations in your life.\n\nHere's how you get rid of this addiction:\n\nYou don't focus on quitting porn so you can finally get to live life after you're recovered.\n\nYou focus on learning how to live, how to manage your emotions, how to change the way you think and view the world.\n\nYou put all your energy into building the life you want.\n\nThis will naturally lead your mind away from porn.\n\nSuccess is not measured by how many clean days you've managed.\n\nIt's measured by how much your life has improved since you started rebooting.\n\nThis is what you need to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #1: Write a life vision for yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you envision your life a few weeks, months, or years from now?\n\nSpend a whole day (or week) thinking about this.\n\nDon't say *I don't know what to do with my life*.\n\nAre you telling me you have no clue what you want in any of the following areas: study, work, family, friends, hobbies, health, etc.?\n\nEven if you're not sure, you need to give your life some direction.\n\nThis is by far the most important part of recovering from pornography addiction.\n\nWrite like crazy. Write many pages if you want. Make the biggest post you've ever done in your journal talking about how you envision your future life.\n\nThis life vision will be the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThis is what you will focus on 100% from now on.\n\nClose your eyes. Visualize it. Write it down.\n\nIf you don't know what you want in life, then this is actually a more serious issue than porn addiction itself.\n\nLike I said, spend a whole week if you need to.\n\nBrainstorm.\n\nAsk for advice.\n\nTake a notebook and go to a park.\n\nInspire yourself.\n\nThis is the beginning of your recovery.\n\n**Take it seriously.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #2: Give urgency to your life vision\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, now you know what you want in life. Even if you're still unsure in some areas, such as not knowing what to study, that's ok. At least you can give your life some direction for the moment. This is very important. You need to give your life direction. You need to move towards something.\n\nHere's the problem. Many of us know what we want, but we keep delaying it. We're experts at delaying goals. We wait until New Years, or the beginning of a month, or until circumstances get better.\n\nSo this is what you're going to do now:\n\nYou're going to give urgency to your life vision.\n\nWrite down why you ABSOLUTELY MUST start working on it right now.\n\nMake another huge post or journal entry about it.\n\nLet's suppose you're 27 and you have no job, no car, still live with your parents, and spend most of the day playing video games. Why in the world would you wait more time before starting to do something about it? This is urgent bro. You're fucking 27!\n\nOr maybe you've never had a girlfriend in your life before. Well, what are you waiting for? Go buy some nice clothes, start going out more frequently, make mistakes, get rejected, ask women on dates. Start getting some experience NOW.\n\nYou have back pain? Start working on it. Don't wait. The more you wait the worse it gets. Start doing yoga or swimming. Move your hips and back constantly every day.\n\nWrite down reasons why you must start pursuing your life vision right now.\n\nYou have to stop living like this.\n\nThis is urgent.\n\nThis is high priority.\n\nWe must convince ourselves that change is imminent.\n\nIt's very important.\n\nA life vision is no good if you have no urgency.\n\nYou'll just keep delaying it. Waiting for circumstances to improve. Waiting for motivation to arrive. Waiting for the beginning of new year.\n\n**Create urgency.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #3: Develop an indestructible belief in yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the main reasons we quit goals is because deep inside we don't believe we're actually able to do it.\n\nWhen successful people like Arnold Schwarzenegger decide they want to achieve something, they become completely obsessed about it. They have an indestructible belief that they will achieve it.\n\nThey are not affected by circumstances. They create results in their head before they even get them.\n\nThis is what you have to do if you want to accomplish anything.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to learn how to play guitar. And you have the urgency to do it, because you know it takes time, so the sooner you start the better. You have to start now.\n\nHowever, after a few days of learning the basics, you start losing motivation and becoming discouraged. You realize that playing guitar is not easy at all. You feel overwhelmed by how much practice you need to put into it. You start doubting yourself and thinking \"There's no way I'll ever become a great guitar player and form my own band\". Friends tell you things like \"Dude, you should've started years ago. All great guitarists started when they were young\".\n\nSo you quit.\n\nThis is a result of a weak belief in yourself. You don't believe you have the potential to become a good guitarist. Which is obviously completely false. We as humans have unlimited potential.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger doesn't think like this.\n\nLook at what he said:\n\nHow many times have you heard 'You can't do this', 'You can't do that', 'It's never been done before'. I love it when someone says ' No one has ever done this before', because when I do it, that means I'm the first person that's ever done it!\n\nThis is how we should think when we set up to do anything in life.\n\nUncertainty is what kills people. Not knowing if they're able to achieve it.\n\nWe need to brainwash ourselves every day into believing that we WILL do it NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nAll of these steps are equally important.\n\nDo not skip them.\n\nThey are the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThey make rebooting so much easier. Your mind will be completely focused on what you want in life. You will be fixing the root of all your problems.\n\nThe secret of change is to focus all your energy not fighting the old, but on building the new.\n\nStop making posts complaining about your shitty life. Stop making posts saying how you're sick of being addicted to porn. Stop talking about porn altogether.\n\nInstead, transform your journal into a self-improvement journal, focused 100% on moving towards the life you want.\n\n**\"Forget\" about porn.**\n\nThis is basic rebooting stuff, yet many people are constantly breaking this rule. They write about porn cravings, morning woods, spontaneous erections, what day they're on, how much they struggled to abstain, how they can't wait to reach 90 days, etc.\n\nWhen you consistently focus 100% on building the life you want, your mind will naturally move away from porn. You will also lessen the void left by quitting porn, which is very real.\n\nMany people quit porn only to find themselves in this life emptiness that is very hard to handle. Then they go back to porn precisely because this void is too much for them.\n\nFocusing on your life vision is a superior rebooting approach.\n\nRelapses aren't that discouraging if you're actually improving your life. Ironically, you will notice that the more you focus on what you want, the less frequently you will relapse.\n\nIt's important that you think in terms of life vision and pursuing your dreams, not in terms of \"I have to get busy and fill my life with activities so that I don't watch porn\". This is something you're doing for yourself.\n\nStop ranting about porn.\n\n**This journey is about your LIFE.**\n\nFocus on that and the porn will go away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Managing Your Emotional Life\n\n# \n\nOk, let's keep going.\n\nPorn addiction is much more than just getting cravings and relapsing.\n\nOne of the reasons we become addicted is because of our inability to manage our emotional lives.\n\nYou have to remind yourself that quitting porn is about growing up and becoming a much more mature person.\n\nIt's much more than *I want to quit porn so I can cure ED and have plenty of sex with women!*.\n\nMuch more than that.\n\nWe've been using porn for years as a method of handling our emotions.\n\nWe need to stop hiding away from uncomfortable life situations. We need to stop using porn in order to escape from reality.\n\nWe must learn how to handle life and emotions without the need of porn.\n\nWe need to understand that one of the reasons we relapse is because we're pussies that can't handle negative emotions.\n\nWe use porn as medication. We use porn to hide away from life. We use porn to temporarily relief anxiety, stress, loneliness, boredom, anger, etc.\n\nReadjusting Your Sexual Expectations\n\nThis is by far one of the most difficult things to do.\n\nWhen you quit porn, you're not just saying good bye to artificial stimulation.\n\nYou're leaving behind the world of \"never ending flow of hot chicks with big tits and round asses\".\n\nReal life is nothing like that.\n\nWe've been spoiled by porn. We believe that we should be out there having lots of sex with different women. We believe that this is the key to happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThe problem is that it is incredibly difficult and unrealistic to \"fuck hot chicks on a regular basis\".\n\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with having that goal, but you have to be willing to take some MASSIVE action. You have to go through hundreds of rejections. You need to have a lot of balls. **You must do what 99.9% of men are incredibly afraid to do.**\n\nHow many people here are doing what it takes to have the kind of sexual life we all dream about?\n\nVery few, if any. We see these super hot chicks on tight dresses and we hope that maybe someday we might be able to have sex with them. We read books about seduction. We visit PUA forums. We watch videos on YouTube of guys approaching girls. We make theories and discuss them online.\n\nBut we aren't doing shit about it.\n\nIt's all just a dream. An idea we have in our minds. Something we hope someday we will do.\n\nHere's how most people get laid in real life:\n\nA guy meets a girl he finds attractive, so he asks her out. They get to know each other. Then they continue to go out and form some sort of relationship. Then after some months the relationship either becomes serious or falls apart.\n\nThat's the real world.\n\nYou have to accept that, unless you're willing to take massive action, you won't fuck anywhere near as many women as you expect to.\n\n**Accepting this is very difficult, but it is necessary.**\n\nWe need to learn how to live without this world of endless hot chicks, otherwise we'll become extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with real life, which is nothing like porn.\n\nAnyone here is more than capable of getting a girlfriend. But our girlfriends most likely won't look like pornstars, nor they will act like them.\n\nThere's a very high probability the sex won't be pornographic in nature. There's going to be a lot of sensuality, caressing, and also clumsiness. Some days your girl will look sexy, other days not so much. Some days she'll be in the mood, other days she won't. Some days you'll struggle to keep it hard, other days you'll cum too fast. She might be able to achieve orgasms, or she might not. You might do it every other day, or maybe only 3-4 times per month.\n\nRemember, pornstars are paid thousands of dollars to do what they're told and fulfill all your fantasies.\n\n**You must stop living in dream land.**\n\nI know this is very difficult to accept, but we have to give meaning to our lives outside fucking hot chicks.\n\nOur happiness cannot depend on that. Otherwise you'll keep coming back to porn every time you fail to get laid in real life. You will remain attached to \"sex with hot chicks\" for the rest of your life. You have to change the way you view sex and women, because I can assure you it has been completely distorted by porn.\n\nBy the way, I don't believe there's anything wrong about pursuing casual sex instead of a relationship, just make sure you keep both feet on the ground.\n\nI would also like to add that relationships are about sharing your life with another person. I know many people here want a girlfriend so that they can finally start getting laid, but relationships go much more deeper than that.\n\nIf you've never had a girlfriend before you'll know once you get one.\n\nThinking About Sex is USELESS\n\nWhat's the point of fantasizing?\n\nIt accomplishes nothing.\n\nIt slows down the reboot, increases the urge to masturbate, and reinforces neurological pathways related to porn.\n\nIt's a meaningless activity that should be eliminated.\n\nIt keeps your mind focused on sex, tits, asses, fucking, when it should be shifted towards other activities in life.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about sex, you should mindfully and calmly redirect your attention to something else.\n\nYou want sex?\n\nGreat.\n\nThen do something to actually make it happen.\n\nFantasizing by itself serves no purpose at all.\n\nYou need to understand that if you want to abstain from orgasm and masturbation, you cannot be thinking about sex and women, because this will inevitably cause you to relapse. Trying to abstain while at the same time fantasizing or peeking at pictures of chicks will only lead to frustration.\n\nStay away from any kind of artificial stimulation. Don't take peeks. Don't browse pictures of girls online. Don't type pornstar names on Google image search. Don't read escort forums.\n\n**Do not arouse yourself.**\n\nBasically you have to adopt a philosophy of \"I'm either trying to get laid (approaching, texting girls, going out on dates, flirting with women, hanging out with friends, getting rejected) or doing something completely unrelated to sex (work, studying, exercise, fun, reading, playing an instrument, chores, housework, watching movies)\".\n\nThere is no grey area where you are alone thinking about sex or checking out girls online. This accomplishes nothing. It serves no real purpose. It will only increase urges, lead to relapse, and make you frustrated.\n\nAs soon as erotic thoughts pop up in your mind, you should calmly ignore them and refocus your attention to something else. You keep practicing this forever until you master it.\n\nYou have to attack this addiction right from the root. Trying to abstain from hardcore porn accomplishes nothing if you're still constantly fantasizing and peeking.\n\nIf you keep strengthening the mindset I talked about above, you will be making meaningful progress.\n\nThis used to be called \"Monk Mode\", but I don't like that name because it implies that you're going to become celibate.\n\nThis isn't about becoming celibate. This is about doing what it takes if you want to get laid, instead of wasting mental energy on sexual thoughts that will only improve the chances of relapsing.\n\nIf you ever want to achieve a long streak, you can't be checking out girls online, even if it's just some bikini pictures. You can't be fantasizing when you wake up in the morning. You can't be taking 5 second peeks at porn.\n\nAs soon as you do any of those things, this huge beast called porn addiction will take control over your prefrontal cortex and it's just a matter of time before you relapse.\n\nYou have to be extreme.\n\nBut don't worry, it's much easier than it sounds.\n\nIt's actually harder to stop yourself from relapsing once you're already thinking about sex, than it is to not think about sex in the first place.\n\nHow do you not think about sex?\n\nSimple.\n\n**Focus your mind 100% on your life vision.**\n\nEvery....single....day.\n\nDismissing erotic thoughts as soon as they arrive in your mind is the cornerstone for preventing relapses.\n\nThis is basic stuff guys.\n\nIt's Not Orgasm What You Crave\n\nMany people here believe that abstaining from orgasm is the most difficult part of rebooting.\n\n**WRONG.**\n\nWhen you get porn cravings, your brain is not asking for orgasm. As an addict, it is begging you for your hit. It misses the high, the tits, the asses, the novelty, the rush, the unrealistic sexual scenarios, the fantasies, the super hot chicks, the perfect camera shots, the feeling of letting go and indulging in pleasure, the fucking, the cumshots, the doggystyles, the boobs bouncing around, etc.\n\nIf lack of orgasm was the problem, then everyone would just fap without porn (or any other artificial stimulation). There would be no relapses and everyone would have 500+ day counters.\n\nThe urge to ejaculate only becomes a real problem once you start peeking, edging or fantasizing constantly. When you find yourself in a state of arousal then obviously you will want to cum.\n\nBut the initial urges are \"addiction urges\". They are mental. They are not a physical need for ejaculation.\n\nIf you feed these urges by peeking, even if it's just pictures of hot babes in bikini, then they will invade your mind and rob you of your ability to concentrate or remain calm. Eventually \"autopilot\" mode will be engaged and we all know what happens next.\n\n**You're not having urges to cum.**\n\n**You're having urges for a \"high\" and a \"rush\".**\n\nRemember that.\n\nThis is why porn urges don't go away when you get a girlfriend.\n\nIt is a drug, and you need to learn how to live without it, regardless of whether you have a girlfriend or not.\n\nWhen you abstain for several days or weeks, your sensitized pathways are anxiously waiting for any sexual cue, no matter how short or brief. This is why people mistakenly confuse real libido with porn cravings. They take a peek at porn after 15 days and they feel this intense rush and urge to cum, so they conclude that it is libido and that they must relieve pressure.\n\nThe problem was taking a peek in the first place. Had they just focused on more important things instead, they would've been able to finish the day clean without problem.\n\nIf you manage to completely abstain from fantasizing and checking out chicks online (in any form), then going a long time without orgasm won't be a problem.\n\nAnd don't even think about testing or caressing your dick.\n\n**Focus 100% on your life vision.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Counters vs Spreadsheets\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following advice is aimed particularly towards those members who are having trouble getting a good run. If you're already doing good, you can skip this section.\n\nOk, here's the thing:\n\nThere is a sickening obsession with long streaks on this forum.\n\nPeople like counters because supposedly they are helpful for tracking progress.\n\nWell, guess what? Spreadsheets do a much better job at that.\n\nThere's a reason why I'm so stubborn with this anti-counter thing.\n\nThey are dangerous, destructive, counterproductive.\n\nCounters reinforce the idea of being \"back to zero\" every time you relapse, making it way more justifiable to binge before starting over again. Not only that, but you completely lose track of how many times you're actually masturbating. They don't show the whole picture. There is absolutely no way to measure your progress at all. It's a never ending cycle of abstaining for a few days and then going back to zero.\n\nEvery time you reset your counter you become increasingly discouraged and unmotivated.\n\nThere's too much emphasis on what day you're on, no fap challenges (there are currently 7 no fap challenges running, it's ridiculous), 90 days, 100 days, etc.\n\nIf you're consistently unable to get past XX days and you're always in the low numbers, then your counter has lost its purpose.\n\nCounters are only good when you've managed a good run, because this gives you a sense of accomplishment and provides sufficient accountability to actually prevent relapses sometimes.\n\nNow, let's talk about spreadsheets:\n\n\\- They keep your addiction under control: By keeping track of how many times you're actually masturbating and having orgasms, you will be forced to keep it in the low numbers. If you relapse, the spreadsheet will discourage you to binge, especially when you're sharing it with the forum. A good rule of thumb is to try to keep your orgasm count to less than 5 per month.\n\n\\- They allow you to see the full picture. In gameover's words: \"You don't realise how you forget over a month how many times you actually masturbate, peek, pmo or orgasm until you have it in front of you. I thought i was well under 3-4 orgasms a month but I have been up around 6-7 and this month was no better.\" You'll be surprised at how many times you're actually fapping.\n\n\\- They completely eliminate the \"counting\" factor. All you have to do is keep it as clean as you can. Pretty cool eh? No more counting, no more 90 day goals, no more fap challenges. After all, we're trying to quit porn for life, not just 100 days or whatever.\n\n\\- They will never discourage you. If you do relapse, you input it on the spreadsheet and move on. You don't make a new thread called \"Relapsed again\" or \"Not making any progress\". Trust me, if you went from fapping 25 times per month to 2-3 times per month, you're making huge progress, even if your counter only says \"6 days\".\n\nSpreadsheets are NOT a taper off approach, of course. The goal should always be to never watch porn, to be as clean as you can, to take it one day at a time.\n\nTapering off, as in \"I watched porn 20 times last month, so I'll watch it 15 times this month\", will never work. You should never think like this. You should never give yourself the green light to PMO.\n\nIdeally, you should replace your counter with a spreadsheet and completely forget about what day you're on. Then, if you do manage to get on a good run, you can put your counter back up for accountability and motivational purposes.\n\nHowever, I understand many people here are in love with their counters.\n\nThey look pretty.\n\nThey are fancy.\n\nI get it, I get it.\n\nSo this is what I propose:\n\n(Once again, this ONLY applies to people who are struggling. If you're already on day 70 or whatever then don't change anything, but consider using a spreadsheet if you do end up relapsing.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, the typical rebooting advice of *Hey man, just do a 90 day reboot* is basically useless.\n\nThis is a very serious addiction and should be treated as such.\n\nWillpower alone won't do it.\n\nChange the way you live.\n\nChange the way you think.\n\nAnd please, stop making so many posts about porn, cravings, urges, relapsing, erections, 90 days, etc.\n\nInstead, **focus on the most important thing:**\n\n**Your life.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGotta clarify some things:\n\nI have never said that the reason we started watching porn was because of life problems. In fact, I would argue that is not the case for the majority of us.\n\nI didn't have any childhood issues or family problems when I was young. I just discovered porn on my own and liked it because it was very pleasurable. As kids and teenagers we are curious and horny.\n\nHowever, as years go by, we become dependent on it not only because of its extreme addictive nature and accessibility, but also because we start using it as a way to cope with life.\n\nThe reason we start using porn and the reason we continue to use porn once we're addicts aren't necessarily the same.\n\nI also didn't mean to say that all porn addicts have shitty lives. Actually by shitty all I mean is being dissatisfied in one way or another. Maybe you constantly put off your goals. Or maybe you waste a lot of time online and want to change that. That doesn't mean your life is shit. It just means it could be better.\n\nI am completely aware there are exceptions. There is a guy who told me he had no problems getting instant makeouts and fucking chicks the same day he meets them. There are others who actually have incredibly busy lives and only watch porn to get some pleasure and relax.\n\nWhatever your situation is, the main point of my post still stands. You should focus on moving towards what you want, instead of constantly complaining and wasting lots of energy on staying away from porn.\n\n**Concentrate on building the life you dream about and this will help you tremendously on your quest to overcome your addiction to porn.**",

      "body": "1. Your core friendship group will evolve over the coming years. Prioritise similarity of values over perceived social standing when it comes to selecting newcomers.\n2. Don’t feel insecure about peers who get off to a fast start, careerwise. We each work at our own pace, and you have plenty of time to figure out your true calling.\n3. If you want people to perceive you as mature; use your manners, treat others with respect and show plenty of humility.\n4. If you start saving and investing now, you’ll thank yourself later. At the same time, go easy on yourself if you don't manage to save much at all. There's plenty of time to play catch-up in your mid to late twenties and thirties.\n5. Find yourself a great mentor. Someone who holds themselves accountable for your progress, but takes no credit for your success.\n6. If you're having no luck with the ladies (or men, if you’re that way inclined), maybe it's just not your time yet. Overall, for men, dating becomes a lot easier in our later twenties/thirties.\n7. If you want to find your passion, get busy trying your hand at anything. Inspiration for passion often comes to those who are already busy working at something else.\n8. Don’t be in a rush to be taken seriously as an adult. By the time you are, you'll miss how much freedom from responsibility you had in your early twenties.\n\nPlease share any additional advice that comes to mind!",

      "body": "Hey all, I started going to therapy at my lowest point, but then realized that it's actually the key to get to my highest point. So I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm still going. These lessons have completely changed my life. Hope it does the same to some of you:\n\n1. You are what you think. If you think badly of yourself, you will feel bad, and vice versa.\n2. Emotions are not problems, but signals for you. Fear shows you that something is important to you, that you don't want to lose something. Anger means that someone has crossed your boundaries. Panic and anxiety show you that you are living in the future with your thoughts and that you need to come back to the present.\n3. Routines and habits change your life, not your motivation. Change your routines, change your habits, and everything will change, for better or for worse.\n4. See your past as a book. Feel free to read it from time to time, but don't live in it.\n5. Control is a myth. The only superpower we have is the decisions we make every day.\n\nWhich one do you like most? And if you have any actionable tips related to these, feel free to share them in the comments. I'll do the same.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit, since so many asked and my comment with my learnings how to turn these \"theoretical\" concepts into action got buried a bit in the comments, adding them here again:\n\n1. Thinking good of yourself is for me a combination of self-worth and self-esteem. For self-worth, it helped me to do a sanity check what my values are and whether I'm living according to them. It has nothing to do with external validation, you need to be fine with yourself and to do so, your actions need to be in balance with your values. For self-esteem, convince your brain that you are better than others and that you do what you say you are going to do. Start small, the easiest thing is to always walk the stairs. Everyone else takes the elevator and the moving stairs\n2. Make emotions work for you, not against you. Luckily we grab our phone every time we are running away from something \"negative\" inside of us. I'm using the Lemio app to block social media apps and every time I end up there, I can use it as a trigger moment to reverse-engineer my emotions. Can recommend the RAIN framework to do so\n3. My biggest routine change was my morning routine. All distracting apps are blocked, instead I do stretching first thing after getting up. I do temptation bundling on top, meaning I can only listen to my favorite podcast in the morning if I do the stretching + a few exercises. Listening is ok, but just this one, and afterwards I jump straight to work\n4. Journaling helps a lot with this. Writing down top 3 every what you are grateful for and another 3 what you are looking forward to tomorrow\n5. My best tip here is to stop checking the news. It's negative and out of your control. No one cares what you think of politics if you don't get active in it. For me it's a complete waste of time even to spend time on things that you feel like they are important for society, but then not acting on them. If you can't control/impact it, and if you don't act on them, why should you spend so much time on them?",

      "body": "Last year, I was completely burned out. My brain felt fried. Every free moment, I’d grab my phone, scrolling Instagram, checking notifications, or flipping through the same few apps like a robot. It was like my mind was on a loop most of the time.\n\nIt wasn’t just about wasting time. I couldn’t handle quiet moments. Waiting in line, sitting still, or even walking outside, my hand would automatically reach for my phone. It was like it had a mind of its own.\n\nSo I decided to try something big: a dopamine reset. I wanted to teach my brain to find joy without endless scrolling. It wasn’t perfect, but it’s the best thing I’ve done so far.\n\nHere’s what helped me:\n\n**Dopamine Detox:** Going cold turkey sounded awful, so I started by cutting my screen time in half over a couple weeks. I set strict limits on social media and other distractions.\n\n**Swap the Habit:** When I felt the urge to check my phone, I’d grab a book or head outside. Sounds simple, but it really helped break the cycle.\n\n**Lock It Down:** I used app blockers to keep mornings and evenings phone free. No way to cheat. It’s wild how clear your mind gets without notifications hitting you first thing.\n\n**Embrace Boredom:** At first, boredom felt uncomfortable, almost weird. But over time, I started to love those empty moments. That’s where the calm and creative ideas show up.\n\nNow, a few months later, I feel sharper, calmer, and way more present. I’m not perfect, some days I still get sucked back into scrolling. But overall, it feels like I’ve got my brain back. It’s not just about being productive, it’s about feeling like myself again, not just a slave to my phone.",

Just to clarify now… **EVERYTIME I HAVE GOTTEN BACK ON THIS SITE IT SUCKS.**\n\nAround when I made this account 10 years ago this site was very different. I was active on many subs, and was very popular on a few for video-games. I loved the site and used it as a downtime when I was not with friends or family, or doing school work.\n\nSomething changed around 2016-17. I began to notice a shift in the site. It slowly got worse.\n\nI one time made a post and got. “Your name is Camogamer123, way to tell on yourself.” My post had nothing controversial or political in it.\n\nI would post on relationship boards about the mistakes an ex and I made. I would get told that “everything is your fault you POS.”\n\nMore recently when making a post I get “well looking at your history you are an alcoholic drug doing Catholic.” Etc… etc…\n\nI also moderated one of the largest subs on my alt… The comments and threats I got were incredible.\n\n**Recently I cleared my entire profile and periodically delete everything. This site is filled with terminally online freaks who fancy themselves activist against normal people.**\n\n**The greatest way to improve yourself is to get offline and strengthen your bonds IRL.** I have never felt better than the times I was far away from Reddit/Discord/Social Media.\n\nI feel strong. I have forgiven myself. I have many irl friends. I work out. I have a stable job. I have money to do things I love.\n\n**All of this online activity breeds extremism.

      "body": "Pornography, Hollywood, and other forms of media have deluded men into false perceptions of women think and how attraction works.\n\nPorn is a falsified, artificially constructed representation of human sexuality, where attraction and arousal are instantaneous, easy and abundant without true effort.\n\nOn the other side, mainstream movies, i.e. romance porn, often portray unquestioned dedication as the ultimate way to woman’s heart. Unremarkable, piddling men will win a beautiful woman over through some grand act of devotion, reinforcing that idea that men can be mediocre and still attract beautiful women solely through sacrifice.\n\nLogically, we understand that movies and porn are fictional, but without experience or baseline knowledge, these misrepresentations become reality if reinforced early on.\n\nThese contradictory messages that women are owed to us (porn) and that they must be earned (mainstream media) have fucked up many men’s expectations and ability to handle rejection.\n\nMen who are inundated in this mindset and who have experienced a series of rejections from women, begin to view women as a monolithic group that have rejected them in totality, who are looking down them from a pedestal. Rather than understanding that romantic/sexual rejection is something that happens frequently and is not a source of shame.\n\nRed pillers, incels, and PUAs, are born out this. They blame women for being superficial or unattainable, they use band aids and tactics, rather than taking complete accountability an working to become an inherently attractive, interesting person. Even PUAs who achieve superficial success crumble when they encounter rejection, because their identity is largely predicated on acceptance from women.\n\nOur society worships at the altar of the Victim. It’s difficult to take complete ownership of your faults and failures, I certainly struggle with taking ownership at times.\n\nThis is not a pro-feminist post. This concept applies to both men and women. You and I completely responsible for our successes and failures, not anyone else.\n\nWomen are not owed to you, the same way your attraction owed to anyone else. Women did not have a secret global meeting and deem you unworthy. Everyone experiences rejection—those who imply that they don’t experience it are delusional or liars.\n\nYou are not victim. Your attractiveness or any other facet of your personality is not static. Your success solely depends on personal accountability and willingness to experience discomfort in order to grow.\n\nEdit: ‘Fault’ should be replaced with ‘Responsibility’, but the same concept applies\n\nEdit 2: This post got me permanently banned from the social skills sub 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🥂",

I am also glad my post helped some too. Thank you for those who sent awards and best wishes. <3*\n\nI am not sure if this post fits this subreddit but I want to share what I am going through in a hope it may help someone else.\n\n12 hours ago, I was in the worst accident of my life. I thought I am dead but I survived without any major injuries.\n\nI was riding my motorbike bike and was going back to home. I use the same route everyday. Yesterday, there was a traffic jam and I estimated it would take 5-10 minutes. Instead of waiting, I can take another route which is a 4-lane road.\n\nI was riding as usual and was on lane 2 from left and suddenly a car from my left tried to overtake and slightly pushed/hit me from my left side. I tried to control it. First it went right, then left, and then right in to the 4th lane with heavy traffic.\n\nThere was a Ford 150 like car on the 4th lane that slammed the brake. In those moments, time felt slow, I can feel my body and bike falling meanwhile hearing the screeching sound of brakes of everyone behind me.\n\nFortunately, there was no big vehicle behind me and that driver slammed the brake in the right time. I got control of my bike and saved myself from crashing into the barrier on the right side. But it hit my left leg badly.\n\nIts been 12 hours since then I am still in shock. My brain and mind feels empty, those worries, anxieties, and thoughts are missing and in a way I am liking it. It feels so empty and peaceful and in the meantime life feels so meaningless. I could have died yesterday and all the struggles, my savings, my wife, my family, friends and everything I have would have disappeared in 5 minutes.\n\nI overthink a lot about everything, have anxiety about future, inflation and money, I sacrifice my needs and happiness for others, don't want to hurt others but get hurt.\n\nThe accident has made me realize that life is temporary and very uncertain. I could just die without any fault of my own and all my worries and people I care about won't be able to bring me back. Eventually they will move on.\n\nSo, why I should I waste my life for others?\n\nFrom today and onwards, I am going to appreciate the limited life I have, I will prioritize my needs, my happiness and just myself. Everyone and everything comes after. And instead of thinking about future a lot and saving money, I will spend a good chunk on it on my well being.\n\nI will take care of myself. I will live as I am going to tomorrow and make everything count.\n\nThank you if you have read so far.",

But lately, I’ve realized calmness wins every single time.\n\nBeing calm doesn’t mean being passive or indifferent, it’s learning to respond, not react. It’s walking into a room and not needing to dominate it. It’s being okay with silence, with pauses, with not needing everyone to agree with you. It’s choosing to observe before speaking.\n\nConfidence is great, but calmness is control. It’s emotional maturity in motion. When you’re calm, you think clearly, you listen better, and you don’t let other people’s chaos rewrite your peace. You stop wasting energy trying to prove your worth, you already know it.\n\nIt’s such an underrated part of self improvement. Because once you master calmness, confidence naturally follows, not from ego, but from peace.",

      "body": "I used to think that if I was a good person, things should work out for me. I spent a lot of times doing things that were “good”. I put others over myself and thought that meant good things would happen to me, and well, that didn’t work out as I had expected. I did everything I was supposed to do and ended up sick, tired, and miserable because my underlying beliefs were that I needed to do / be something other than what I was in order to be worthy. \n\nI used to be a perfectionist. I used to be so tough on myself. I never believed I was worthy of good things. My outer life reflected that. I was addicted to adderall, nicotine, anorexic or stuck in disordered eating, over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived, constantly in toxic relationships, and in crippling debt. I thought poorly of myself based on old stories I clung onto. \n\nI’ve healed so much over the last few years but recently I realized that I never stopped to look around to where it got me. I never basked in the glory of this moment. And I still felt badly about myself. \n\nI decided to learn different healing modalities and just tune into myself daily. Instead of thinking of it as work, or something to change, I now know it’s something to do to understand my own beautiful uniqueness and capabilities. \n\nA few weeks ago I had a huge shift. I know it’s because of all of the things I’ve done over the last few years, and because I’ve finally accepted the fact that I am worthy and fully believe it. That feeling hasn’t wavered for weeks, and I don’t see it happening but maybe it will. I have tools to help. \n\nMy life today is beautiful and I feel very grateful. I’ve got everything I need and many things I want. I have a stable job, many things I’m passionate about, and am building a business in addition to my full-time job. \n\nTwo days ago, I had made a mistake. A simple one, but historically, no matter the size of the error, it would send me into a spiral: “I’m an idiot!” “What’s wrong with me?” And ruin my whole day about it. But two days ago, I literally sang, as if I was a kid, “I made a mistake, and that’s OK! Everyone makes mistakes!” Immediately after, I smiled so big because that was showing something deep down inside of me has shifted immensely. \n\nI just received some praise at work yesterday and I was fully open and knew I was deserving of it. It was a big moment as many important people were there to hear it, and I was singled out by name. I didn’t shy away or downplay it, I said thank you, proudly!\n\nThings are falling together because I finally know that I am worthy. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that really wonderful things can happen once you focus your energy on you. We can’t change what we did in the past. I spent so much years in shame over things I did when I didn’t know better. Beating yourself up today does nothing but ruin this moment. \n\nI wanted to share some affirmations as a practice if anyone is interested. They have really helped me on my journey. \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn’t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.  \n\n_\nTL;DR\n\naffirmations:  \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn’t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for the support. I’m so glad so many of you resonate. I have a podcast called Everyday Perspectives where I unpack topics like this, shifting mindset from victim to co-creator with life.

      "body": "For years, I was stuck in a loop. I'd set huge goals, feel overwhelmed, procrastinate, and then feel guilty. The cycle was exhausting. I read books, watched videos, but nothing stuck.\n\nThe breakthrough came from a surprisingly simple concept backed by psychology: The Progress Principle.\n\nResearch from Harvard shows that the most powerful motivator for people isn't a big reward or praise, but simply the feeling of making progress in meaningful work. Every time you complete a small task, your brain releases a hit of dopamine. This isn't just a \"feel-good\" chemical; it's a \"do-it-again\" chemical. It creates a feedback loop of motivation.\n\nBig goals don't provide this regular feedback. They are too far away. But small, daily wins do.\n\nSo, I stopped focusing on \"writing a book\" or \"getting fit.\" Instead, I started focusing on insanely small wins.\n\nHere's the practical system I used:\n\nBreak It Down to Absurdity: Instead of \"Go to the gym,\" my goal became \"Put on my gym shoes.\" That's it. Once the shoes were on, going to the gym felt like the next logical step. Instead of \"Write 1,000 words,\" it was \"Open the document and write one sentence.\"\n\nFocus on the \"One Thing\": Each day, I'd pick just ONE such tiny task for my main goal. The goal wasn't to finish the project; it was just to complete that one tiny action.\n\nTrack the Wins, Not the Work: I got a simple wall calendar and put a big 'X' on every day I completed my tiny task. Seeing the chain of X's grow became its own motivation. It was visual proof of my progress, no matter how small. This visual cue is extremely powerful.\n\nAcknowledge the Win: After putting the 'X' on the calendar, I'd take 10 seconds to literally tell myself, \"Good job. You did the thing.\" It sounds silly, but you're consciously closing the feedback loop and reinforcing the habit.\nThis system works because it hacks your brain's natural wiring. It bypasses the fear and overwhelm of big goals and instead builds a chain of small, dopamine-fueled achievements. It slowly builds momentum until it feels unstoppable.\n\nIf you're stuck, try this. Pick one goal, break it down into the smallest possible step, and just focus on doing that one tiny thing today.\nHope this helps someone.",

      "title": "I Started Focusing On Self Improvement 3.5 years ago - It Has Made A HUGE Difference, Here Are My Main Tips",
      "body": "I used to really struggle. I had self-esteem issues, organizational issues, would procrastinate and fail classes. However in the past few years, I started focusing on improving myself, and since then I've bought a house, significantly advanced my career (receiving top performance ratings and other accolades), and I've been able to pursue hobbies and grow my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 years (hopefully soon-to-be fiance). I think dating her made me realize that I had to straighten some of my own stuff out, and that's probably what initially set me off down this path of personal improvement.\n\nHere are a few key points I picked up along the way: \n\n**I needed to learn what my values are.** This is an exercise from the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey (BTW, this is my #1 Personal Development book ever, definitely read it or at least the spark notes if you haven't already). Imagine you die and you're attending your own funeral (either as a guest, a ghost, etc). Imagine various people from your life are speaking at your funeral - this might include your parents, spouse, coworkers, friends, etc... What do you want them to say about you? When I performed this exercise, I realized that I wanted people to remember me as loving and supportive, inspirational, hard-working to provide hope and alleviate suffering both in my local and global community, etc. I wrote these things down, and it eventually evolved into my Personal Mission Statement - a series of bullet points that summarize the values I want to embody in my daily life. I try to read this daily or at least a few times a week. It keeps me centered on what is truly valuable in my life so that I can make an effort to focus on those things rather than getting caught up in the distractions. This is a great first step - ideally, everything in your life should be aligned with your values. There's also a phrase I appreciate - Memento Mori - Latin for Remember Death. It sounds morbid, but if I think that these next 15 minutes could be the last 15 minutes I have, then it makes me reflect on what I'm currently doing and if it's how I want to spend the last few minutes I have - does it align with my Personal Mission Statement. (Is writing this Reddit post really how I want to spend my last 15 minutes??? Yes, yes it is. I'll come back to this later.)\n\n**I needed to learn self-awareness.** This is sooo important. If you are more self-aware, you'll be able to notice your emotions and actions, and if they are aligned with your values. If you notice that you are feeling depressed, stressed, angry, etc then you can do something about it. If I notice that I'm stressed out, then I might make adjustments to my plan. Maybe before I go interact with others, I try to spend an hour at home either taking a nap, or a bath, or exercising, or whatever to help calm my nerves. It's all about practice. To become more self-aware, you can try journaling to reflect on your day/life, you can try meditating, or you can even talk with someone you trust and reflect on your lives/actions. These things have all helped me out. It also takes practice/experimentation to understand what works well or doesn't work well to help you out when you're in these various states of mind. For example, if I'm feeling depressed, I've found that I shouldn't watch TV or play video games, but exercise, going outdoors, and spending time connecting with loved ones is very beneficial. \n\n**I needed to learn how to focus on what truly matters.** There are two parts to this: eliminating distractions, and then working on important, value-added activities. \n\n1. **Eliminating distractions**: Understanding my values has helped me to focus on the right stuff, and self-awareness has helped me to realize when I'm focused and if I'm not focused then what's causing the distraction. Growing up and all the way into my early 20's, I've always been very disorganized and distractable. However, I realized that if I can eliminate the distractions then it gives me space to freely work toward those things that align with my values. Eliminating distractions is a constant journey, and there are literally distractions in every part of my life. Here are some examples, and what I did about them. \n   1. Facebook/social media (yes, even Reddit) - I often found myself mindlessly scrolling through these online platforms, often for more than an hour each day. I deleted the apps from my phone. I then found myself going through my phone internet browser, so I even found how to block the website from my internet browser. \n   2. Emails - I realized my inbox would get filled with tons of stuff each day, most of which didn't add much/any value to my life. I unsubscribed from almost all emails, and when an email no longer needs my attention, then I archive it. \n   3. Physical clutter - Did you ever have an essay due tomorrow, and you'd find yourself cleaning the whole house to distract yourself? Maybe it's just me. Anyways, I have been on a journey of eliminating those little things that might distract me. Do I really need 30 shirts, so I spend 10 minutes sorting through them and figuring out the perfect outfit? Nooooooo. You can probably tell, this is basically minimalism. Minimalism can get some strong reactions from people, so I was hesitant to use that term, but yes I've adopted many minimalism philosophies/practices. \n2. **Completing value-added tasks**: I personally really benefit from checklists. It helps me to keep track of what is important and I find a lot of satisfaction in completing the things that are important and then crossing them off the list. I started using an app called Todoist on my phone and computer, and it's great. Because I'm so distractable, I have literally everything on that app haha it sounds a bit ridiculous, but it even includes things like brushing teeth and making the bed. Also, I believe in the 80/20 rule - spend 20% of the effort to get 80% of the impact, you can always go back later and put in more effort if you get some time. But it's important to keep moving onto the next goals. For example, when lifting weights, I focus on the big 3: squats, deadlifts, and bench press. If I only have 30 minutes to work out, I want to make sure I get the biggest bang for my buck. There are three general categories of tasks to focus on. \n   1. Sustainment tasks: these are things like exercising, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, practicing good hygiene, and caring for loved ones. These are crucial, because if they get neglected, then eventually I will find myself in a situation where I am not free to work toward my dreams. For example, if I neglect my health, then I will get sick which will drain me of energy and money - two essential resources.\n   2. Tasks that eliminate distractions and streamline the sustainment tasks: these are tasks like purging old items, clearing your calendar, etc. For example, I like to meal prep. It saves time and money and ensures I have a healthy diet. I also use Instacart, to help save even more time.\n   3. Tasks that move you forward toward your vision: these are tasks that align with a dream or vision that you have. Maybe you want to start up a non-profit, so taking steps toward that. Or maybe you want to start a family, so taking steps toward that. Taking steps toward owning a home.\n\n**I needed to practice financial responsibility.** Fortunately, I've always naturally been a frugal man, so this hasn't been as big of an issue for me as it is for some people. Financial freedom is truly invaluable, it provides opportunities to expand your knowledge and work freely toward those value-added tasks mentioned above. If I relied on the next paycheck to get through the next few weeks, then that gives my boss power over me - he can say I have to work 90 hours next week and not get paid for that overtime, and I don't have as much freedom to tell him to eff off. I have experienced some very tight financial circumstances, and it can be extremely stressful. This isn't meant to be a guide on how to save money and grow wealth. I definitely suggest investing some time and energy into learning about finances if you haven't already.\n\n**I had to learn how to effectively communicate.** I've never been a person to openly talk about feelings or be vulnerable. I've also had difficulty asking for the things I want/need. I've gotten lots of practice through dating my girlfriend as well as my work. These are two separate areas where I get to train and refine my communication skills daily. Being a more effective communicator has allowed me to connect with people on a more personal level, and it helps me to get the weight off my shoulders and get the things I need to thrive. \n\n**Summary**:\n\nSpend time investing in yourself: grow your knowledge, wealth, and freedom. Spend time working toward goals that bring you joy and align with your values and vision for how you want to live your life. To be honest, writing up a long Reddit post isn't my favorite thing to do. But I deeply enjoy helping people, and these online Reddit communities helped me get going on this journey many years ago, so I'm paying it forward. Don't get hyper-focused on self-improvement, doing so can lead to being overly self-critical. Just have fun with it, and keep doing tasks that make your life easier, happier, and bring you more in line with your dreams. I hope this helps somebody. If you have questions/suggestions, please stick it down in the comments or feel free to message me. Have a great day, friends!",

      "body": "Don’t think about you situation too much, you’ll end up creating a problem that wasn’t even there to begin with. \n\nThe mind is a very powerful tool. Everything begins and ends in your mind. What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it. In retrospect, if you keep on thinking about a certain negative thing over and over again, it will control you mind, so far as it will be the first thing you’ll think of when you wake up and the last thing before you sleep. Initially, it will completely take over 100% of your mind, a task that’s very hard to get rid of. \n\nThe best way to live life is to stop thinking about the worst. Instead, think positively in a way that whatever happens happens and you’ll learn from it, no matter the situation. A massive cause for people to panic, worry and become scared is overthinking. We are all guilty of this. Overthinking, quite frankly, ruins you. It will drain everything out of you, until there’s nothing else left. Overthinking ruins the situation, twists and swirls everything around, makes you constantly worry in fear and makes everything worse, when in reality, there is no need for it. \n\nUnderstandably, saying “turn your negative thoughts into positive” isn’t a walk in the park and doesn’t just happen within thin air. It takes guts, time, patience and all your emotions to get through the darkest of days. As I said, time is crucial. It doesn’t take a day, a week or even a month to get rid of negative thoughts inside of your head, it may take a few years, to ensure you’re ready to let go of all the pain and torment your mind has gone through. But, believe you me, once you realise you’re ready and you start to brighten up day by day, it will be the best feeling ever. :) \n\nYou don’t get the same day twice in life. Today’s date is September the 22nd 2020. Just a reminder, you’re never going to see this day again, make the most of it!\n\nEdit: PM’s are open for support. :)",

Nobody can be happy, productive, grateful, sad, worried or angry all the time.  Some days you'll feel pumped up, while other days you might not even want to get out of bed. This is normal. You are human, with a full range of emotions. Let your feelings and moods take their course. Like changing seasons, they will pass. Don’t try to hold on to it or push it away. Just let it pass. If you do the above 5 things, this will be normal. However, if you feel down for longer periods of time, seek professional help.  \n\n\nHope this helps.",

      "title": "What I have learned from working with the rich.",
      "body": "To have multiple zeros in your bank account is a dream for many. To live the rich life. But there are some disadvantages that comes with it as well. \n\nFor the perks, people treat you better. You may even get free things. The irony of it all, is the more money you make, sometimes that opens up doors for you to get things for free. People see you as better and a better member of society just because of your perceived status. It hypes you up but it goes to show how everything is about perception and psychology. And the reality is, people treat you different because you are adjacent to wealth. So them being nice to you is not because of who they are, but because of what they think they can get from you by being close to you. \n\nSo relationships become entirely transactional and it becomes harder to find people who actually care for you as a person. Not just because you have money.  People are in your circle because they want what you have. Not because they genuinely care for you. If you were to lose your wealth, you lose their 'friendship'.\n\nFrom those that work with the rich, they have to deal with the inflated egos and pretentiousness of other rich people who expect you to kiss their ass and worship the ground they walk on. Just because they are rich. Their sense of importance is magnified and they expect you to cater to that. You are expected to treat them like they are royalty and God's best gift. Also overheard a conversation where a worker was reported because he didn't do enough ass kissing. So i guess they didnt feel important enough. They need to feel important. \n\nFor those who aren't rich but picked up the attitude of the rich, (sense of importance is high), they may treat you like shit because to them, you are lower than them even though you may be in the same tax bracket. You as a human are lower than them because they know a few rich people. You see this with luxury store workers as well as high end caterers. It's all about perception.  \n\nSaw the same thing with catering high end events vs being representative staff at high end events. For catering, you are treated as a servant. Nothing more.  For representative jobs,  I was treated better especially when it's a top company. Even at the doctor. They treated me so much better when i had my badge or an item that showed where i worked. The topics people talk about with you are different as well. Being smart is a perk. They don't see you as less than once you're in a certain place. \n\nMy overall observation is that everything is about perception. The way you are treated. The opportunities you get. The circles you get access to. The perks you receive is all about perception. And to meet genuine people, you have to remove what makes people change towards you. This is why keeping your wealth private is important. You get to see the true sides of people. They say money changes people, but it goes both ways. It may change the person who got the wealth by inflating their ego but it also changes peoples perception of you and the way you are treated. \n\nIf you get rich, you have to be careful yourself, because of the better treatment, you get an inflated ego. This may cause you to look down on others and think you are better than them. You may also completely dismiss their problems and concerns. You see them as peasants forgetting you were once seen in the same light by those in the same circle you are now in. \n\nTLDR- If you ever gain wealth, remember where you once were. Stay grounded. You will have people around you that prop you up to the point where your ego gets inflated and if you are not careful, you become a horrible version of the rich people that people hate. You will change but the people around you will change as well. And remember we are all on a floating rock in space. The made up hierarchies is just that, \"made up\". We will all turn to dust in the end. \n\nNot sure if this is the right sub, but wanted to share.",

(EDIT). \n\nIf you can pull or are pulling off all of these each day and you're stressed, understand you're the 1% and that you're truly doing this to yourself. \n\nI promise you most of your boomer bosses bought a home when it was cheaper, have a family or a spouse to split errands with (or probably a stay at home partner who cooks their meals, does the laundry, and cleans). They almost never exercise, or engage in developmental hobbies, and usually spend most of their evening with their loved ones or in front of the TV/PC. \n\nIf you're wondering why others or your co-workers are so happy and care-free, odds are they don't hold these high expectations over themselves or have slowly let them go over time. \n\nBe easy on yourself. This is something I needed to tell myself, and I'm sure someone out there needs to hear it as well.\n\n\nEDIT: I had previously changed my answer from \"They Don't\" to \"Most Don't\" but for some reason it didn't save last night. And to those saying it's possible: I fully know it's possible, I've been doing it for the past 5 years, but what has developed in my experience is a sense of perfectionism and guilt for having missed or not being able to do one of these task; this was a message for those who are being hard on themselves when they feel as if others have it easier (because they usually do).",

      "body": "This is an update post one the one I made two months ago. TLDR: I've (24F) consistently had bad mental health episodes for the last 8 years of my life. Today marks my one year milestone of a year without a bad episode. I was worried I wouldn't make it but I did!\n\nThis time last year I was a totally different person. Single, unemployed, lonely, and depressed. I was in the middle of a particularly bad mental health episode and I decided I couldn't go on this way. So I changed my medication, went to therapy and self help groups and things started looking up. \n\nI got a job in march last year, I also got a boyfriend in march, we'll be coming up to a year in a month's time. Because of work I started making more friends. I also found a new direction to take my life.\n\nI graduated university 3 years ago, but I'm not sure what I want to do with my degree. But actually, I've decided to go in a completely different direction and try to become a tattoo artist. My new years resolution has been to put my art out into the world. And I've started my art Instagram and I've started building a portfolio to help me get an apprenticeship after lockdown. It's something I'm really excited to do. I hope I can do it.\n\nTo celebrate my milestone I took 2 weeks off work. In the time, I did a massive declutter of my room, I made homemade cheese, I cut and dyed my own hair. And I made myself a cake. I mentioned in my last post that a while ago I found a Tumblr post. In this post the girl said something along the lines of \"one day everything will be ok, and on that's day I'll make cherry pie\". And then a few years later she posted a photo of a cherry pie. Well this is that for me. One day everything will be ok, and on that day, I'll make cake. Well today is that day! I made myself a dulce de leche cake and it was amazing!! \n\nI've still got ways to go for sure. I'm still working on becoming a healthy weight. I kinda stopped trying to do that around Xmas. I'm still working on my portfolio. To be honest, although I haven't suffered with SAD as bad as I usually do. I've definitely felt lower. Like I've been hibernating. My motivation for my portfolio and weight loss stopped. But now things are getting lighter and I have this boost from my milestone, I'm going to kick myself back into gear. Brush off the cobwebs and wake up a bit. \n\nIf anyone has any advice for helping me wake up and come out of hibernation I'd really appreciate it. I need a good kick up the bum. \n\nThe last thing I have left to do, once I get paid this month, I'll be buying my friends, family and boyfriend small gifts to say thank you for their support during this year. I definitely couldn't have done this alone. No man is an island. \n\nHere's hoping this year will be as good as the last, I hope to see you back here in 2 years! Thank you for taking the time to ready my long-ass post, I appreciate it. \n\nTLDR: I made it one year without a bad mental health episode, it's the best I've ever done. I made myself a cake to celebrate.",

      "body": "Self critical thoughts. Guilty thoughts. Thoughts about what I should have done. Fearful thoughts about what others think. \n\nHow dark are the thoughts that follow you around each day? Mine get pretty dark.\n\nThis is haunting if we let ourselves identify with them. We listen to the fears of inadequacy just because they won’t shut up. We believe we really are failures because it’s all we can think about - no matter how much self improvement we read. If it was possible for us to be fixed then why do we still feel so broken?\n\nStop. We are not our thoughts. I need you to see the bigger picture of who you are - not thoughts but actions. I bet you take great care of your pets even when you feel horrible. I bet you have tried self care like yoga and meditation and journaling so you can feel better. I bet you try to help out your friends and family in little ways. Your actions paint a different picture of you than your thoughts. I can’t stop you from judging yourself, but I can ask you to at least consider all the evidence.\n\nI know you feel a lot of pain. I know the thoughts are dark and you wish they would stop. But don’t you dare believe that those thoughts define who you are. You never chose those thoughts. You didn’t ask to feel the pain and negativity. The real you is the one who decided what actions you wanted to take. Do not base your identity and self image on thoughts you don’t even want in your head. Look at the actions you take. Look at the work you put in, especially on the days when you don’t feel like it. That’s who you are. \n\nYou are the captain of a ship in turbulent water. You are steering your life every day in a storm of thoughts that you can’t control. Here’s the thing. It’s not your fault that this storm is here. Don’t hate yourself because the wind is howling and the ship is rocking. You are not the storm, you just need to steer the ship. It’s easy to think that other people share the thoughts you do. That they think about you as negatively as you do, but that’s not true. They don’t see the storm you feel inside, they just see you steering the ship. They see your actions. They see you trying to help others, they see the work you do, the work you put in, the words you say. The actions are who you choose to be, and the version of you that the world sees. Not your thoughts.\n\nMaybe your actions haven’t been what you wanted lately. Mine haven’t either. That’s hard because it can create even more dark thoughts. But that doesn’t mean you can’t choose different actions today. Your actions today define who you are. Not your actions yesterday, and sure as hell not your negative thoughts. So imagine all your thoughts as waves in the ocean passing through. They come and go, some are painful, but they never last. They are not you. You are not your thoughts. You are your actions, and you can choose your actions.\n\nWho will you choose to be today?\n\n**Further reading:** If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend *Awareness by Anthony de Mello*. When we identify with every thought in our head it’s like walking a tightrope during an earthquake. Negative thoughts pull us in so many directions and life is anything but peaceful or calm. This book is incredible for helping you become aware of your thoughts and step back from the ones that aren’t helpful. His advice helped me catch negative thought loops faster and step out of them. They still come up, but they only get 5 minutes steering the ship before I kick them out, not 5 hours.",

      "body": "Most people assume that ‘having your shit together’ means you’re successful in your career or that you make a lot of money. \n\nIt simply means that you are in control of your life—you take active ownership of your living environment, your health, your ambitions, and your finances. You put in work maintaining certain aspects of your life, which allow you to thrive and maintain your sense of independence.\n\nHaving your life in order indicates that you not only can take care of yourself, but you are able to contribute to a relationship and not be a burden. This is why responsibility is sexy—men and women are biologically driven to seek partners that not only produce healthy children, but can help provide for and raise their children effectively.\n\nNo matter how physically attractive someone is, if their life is in disarray—their place is a mess, they have toxic personal relationships, they have no solid goals, etc.—it is a massive turn off. If someone can’t handle their own lives, how can they be reliable in a relationship.\n\nFeeling safe emotionally is particularly important for women. Personal Instability and lack of reliability is a significant source of emotional distress.\n\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you get your shit together, but here are some general rules:\n\n- Keep your living environment clean and organized. This is paramount. A simple act such as making your bed every morning, doing dishes, making sure your bathroom isn’t nasty and stays fresh. When you bring someone over and your living environment is chaotic, they will feel uneasy and lost attraction.\n\n- Be a person of action, rather than words. Instead of telling someone you’re going to do something, take actionable steps towards your goals. If you say you’re going to do something, follow through.\n\n- Stay on top of your finances. This doesn’t mean you have to be wealthy, but having an understanding of your expenses and savings. Having a basic understanding and knowledge of investing (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, dividends) is necessary to build wealth for yourself.\n\n- Most importantly, maintaining your health. This is not about maintaining your physical appearance(although it’s a positive bonus), but rather making sure your physical and mental well being are maintained. This isn’t always easy—eating well, getting proper sleep, limiting caffeine and alcohol—can be sacrificed for easier options that provide more monetary pleasure.  These seemingly small decisions will have a massive impact on your mental health and quality of life",

I am happy to see I am not alone on this journey - thank you for sharing your experience to all of you! \n\nI’ve seen many questions on how I did it, so I will try to sum it up here. I am just starting this journey, but I can share what has worked for me so far. \n\nFirst thing I started doing is going to therapy - it brought me on the right path. Then step by step I started learning what it means to feel. In the past I simply did not allow myself to feel certain emotions, because I was afraid it would affect other people’s perception of me. So I used to be this calm and reserved person all the time, and I tried to do things constantly, so I could not stop and think and be sad for a second. I was too afraid. This was not real me. \n\nReal me can feel and is okay with any emotion. Real me can speak up when someone passes the limits of my personal boundaries. Real me can be angry. Real me can leave the work earlier because I want to, and go buy an ice cream or go to an exhibition and NOT feel guilty about it. Because what’s the worst thing that will happen? We only got one life. \n\nSo second thing I did is acceptance of my emotions. Third thing is putting my needs and desires first and believing that I don’t owe anything to anyone. It is my life and my choice. And then, once I got rid of some of the psychological boundaries I remembered what I’ve always enjoyed and I started photography, I bought my first camera. \n\nI also try to slow down and look into the window, look at my hands and notice how beautiful they are, smile to myself in the mirror. \n\nOne technique that helped me a lot is setting a timer for every two hours every day, and when I hear this sound, no matter where I am and what I do, I ask myself “How do I feel? Is this what I want to do right now?”. Sometimes it catches me so unawares that I stop doing what I was doing, and do something I really want to do, or just slow down. \n\nI hope you can relate to at least some of it, and thank you again for so many responses. I am beyond happy to see that I am not alone ❤️",

The goal is to inspire and motivate others to try positive changes. P.S.: Only positive habits – no weird stuff like nopoop\n\nUpdate 1: The most upvoted comment suggested that I should always sleep at the same time. Since I already follow something similar by default, I’m going to aim for something like: “making my sleep routine scientifically perfect.”\nHere are the changes: Sleep at 10 PM and wake up at 6 AM, no work or eating 3 hours before bedtime, no screens 1 hour before sleeping and 1 hour after waking up. Expose myself to sunlight quickly after waking up, drink coffee only until 2 PM at the latest, and finally stop sleeping while listening to something (this one will be tough).\n\nI’ll start the challenge tomorrow, January 29th, with a consistent morning routine and proper sleep. Wish me luck!\n\nUpdate 2 (7days):\nIt's been a week, and my assessment is the following: I felt more mental clarity in the first few days. Not using my cell phone for 1 hour after waking up is a game-changer in productivity. I feel much more energetic during the day and sleepier at night. However, for the past 3 days, my sleep has gotten much worse because of problems at work, and I kept feeling the Tetris effect of the day's efforts during my dreams. I'm also having trouble stopping listening to something to sleep. If I don't listen to something, I start reliving the traumas of my life. At least I'm following my bedtime to the letter (only one day I didn't because I went out with my friends and slept 1 hour later).",

      "body": "For years, I tortured myself with failed habits.\n\nMeditation? 3 days and done.  Journaling? A notebook with 10 sad pages collecting dust.  Cold showers? Painful, but pointless.\n\nI thought I was lazy. Turns out, I was just fighting the way my brain works.\n\nHere’s what finally clicked:\n\n\n\n**1. Your brain hates habits but loves patterns**\n\nI used to wait for the perfect reading setup: comfy chair, quiet room, good lighting. That moment never came.\n\nSo I shifted. Instead of mindlessly watch videos and posts on commutes, lunch breaks, or waiting rooms, I read. Result? 3 books in 3 months. Not record-breaking, but a personal win.\n\n\n\n**2. Systems > willpower**\n\nBlank pages killed my journaling attempts. Not knowing where to start = instant shutdown, I felt completely lost.\n\nThen I realized: my brain resists decisions, not writing. I researched decision fatigue so I built this daily note structure:\n\n* Capture → What caught my attention today?\n* Connect → Why does it matter? Does it link to a project/goal?\n* Next step → Is there an action, or just something worth keeping?\n* Top 3 Objectives\n* Task Backlog (auto-shows today’s tasks by priority)\n* Completed Today (auto-log of done tasks)\n* Reflection → What’s going well? What’s blocking me?\n* Tomorrow’s Objectives\n\nThat’s it. No essays. Just fill in the blanks. \n\nIdeas stop floating in sticky notes, apps, and land in one trusted place (for me, it’s digital, but a notebook works too).\n\nOver time, daily notes become a web of insights tied to what I actually care about.\n\n\n\n**3.Progress > perfection\\***\n\nMy gym system is stupidly simple:\n\nShow up. Stretch if I’m not feeling it. Let momentum decide.\n\n80% of the time, I lift. 20% I just walk. Either way = a win\n\n\n\nWhen you design around your actual behaviors (instead of copying routines off social media), progress stops feeling like punishment.\n\nHabits still matter, but when a system absorbs them and gives them a direction (you build it), they stop being a battle. They just… run in the background.\n\nNonetheless, if you try to to do something that definetely doesn't resonate with you, your goals, values, etc. It doesn't matter if you build the most complex and seamless system, you will still not do it. So, this applies just when you care about achieving something (doesn't matter if it is really heart, you will figure out how to do it :) )\n\nWhat has worked for you to make your goals happen?",

She was pretty cool, I got her snap, we talked a lot that night as well as yesterday morning. I was at a meet up with the bros when she asked me to come to town to see her to bar hop and club in Halloween costumes. The bros said 100% go, so I grabbed a costume and headed out.  \n\nTwenty minutes in, she said her and her friends are using the restroom. 10 minutes later I asked her if she has been to a certain bar and got left on read. After ten minutes, I assumed I was ditched so I changed out of my costume and went to my favorite bars in the area because I was already there.  \n\nI ate good food, had some good beer, played pool, talked to some good people, and played darts. It was a good time! I did end up blocking her and considered saying something to her, but thought \"If you don't respect yourself, why should anyone else?\" And having me drive an hour to ditch me in 20 minutes meant she didn't deserve more of my time.  \n\nI used to put up with behavior like this and would forgive them, I was quite the pushover and I have since worked on this extensively. Did things go how they were supposed to? No, but I proved to myself that I respect myself a lot and that's a win in itself.\n\nMake the most out of the bad and never let somebody's shitty behavior towards you ruin your day.",

      "body": "I'm turning 35 today. I wish I was 25. \n\nOh No, I don't want to live forever. Also, it's not that I'm living a life of continuous regret. I just feel that I was slow to start building my dream life.\n\nWhile seeing 18-year-olds making it big does create occasional feelings of envy, I've done enough mindset work to not crave their life. I don't aspire to be anybody else. I just feel that if I had made decisions faster earlier, I could have gotten closer to my dream life sooner.\n\nThis is not to say I'm not doing anything now. I am. But I think reaching my current level of maturity could have happened earlier. I wonder why that didn’t happen. Probably because I was chasing the linear life — getting a good education, getting a job, getting married, and so on. In our culture, there are few who nudge you to forge your own path. It’s hard for people to think independently.\n\nThere’s actually a term for this in psychology: mimetic desire.\n\nIt says that what we think we want is often shaped by what society wants for us. We mistake the dopamine boost from external recognition as a signal of what we truly desire.\n\nSo, how do you separate what you want from what others want you to want?\n\nI don't have a prescription, but I can share how I do it.\n\nAs I went about life, earning good money, gaining recognition, I always felt something inside me was off. I didn’t have words for it until I started reading. After reading 200+ self-help books and doing a lot of reflection over the years, I can articulate it a little better now: it's the feeling of getting closer to your life mission.\n\nWhen I was working full-time at my job, I often felt like I was drifting apart from myself. Now that I'm working on my own venture, I feel much more aligned. This keen sense of direction, this inner compass, is what makes life feel intentional.\n\nI know having a \"life mission\" can sound showy. When I asked some friends about it, they said they just want to live well and be with good people. And of course, everybody does. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you don’t deliberately think about it, you might later feel you missed the opportunity to build a purposeful life, “purpose” not being a buzzword, but something you actually move toward.\n\nI'm not going to repeat clichés like \"the journey is bigger than the destination,\" but what works for me is this: a feeling. A deep internal sense that you're moving in the right direction. We may not have a perfect word for it, but if you've ever felt it, you'll understand. And if you haven't yet, maybe you will later. This feeling that you are on track in life.\n\nNow, how do you create a life mission?\n\nI was stuck there too — until I found a simple yet powerful tool: the life one-pager.\n\nThe original idea of a one-pager, of course, comes from my corporate days.\n\nI loved the idea of creating a one-pager for life like a personal constitution. I first picked it up from the book “*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”*. I fell in love with the concept and created my own life one-pager, clearly writing down my vision, mission, and values.\n\nTo be honest, it took me two years just to understand what \"values\" even meant. It took even longer to rank and define them properly for myself. But eventually, I did. And I know they’ll keep evolving. I'm not chasing perfection, just a better version of myself.\n\nFor those curious, my mission statement is too personal to share fully, but it starts like this: *\"Trying to make the world a better place by using my strengths, desires, and values.\"*\n\nMy top five values today are:\n\n* Learning fast\n* Being creative\n* Being productive\n* Making a difference\n* Following my ten tenets of sustainable happiness (which includes physical health, emotional health, family, friends, and passion)\n\nComing back to the dream life: I thought hard about what a dream life really means for me.\n\nFor some, it’s money, fame, or social recognition. For me, it’s simple:\n\n**My Dream Life: 3-9-3**\n\n* 3 hours reading every morning (without an end goal — just for joy, like how children play)\n* 9 hours working on something I love, with people I enjoy working with\n* 3 hours relaxing and spending time with my wife and family at the end of the day\n\nAnd all of it without worrying about money, not chasing extreme wealth, but securing basic healthcare, emergency cover, and peace of mind.\n\nI don't want to be a constant traveler, but I do want the freedom to take occasional breaks with my wife and visit my parents whenever needed.\n\nThat's why I said I wish I were 25 again, not because I'm unhappy, but because now I know exactly what my 3-9-3 dream life looks like. And I'm very close to achieving it. It's just taking a little longer than I would have ideally wanted, which is still okay (just my opinion).\n\nA final reflection on my 35th birthday:\n\nNo, I don’t have 35 lessons to share. Just one deep realization — something I internalized after reading Viktor Frankl’s “*Man’s Search for Meaning*:”\n\nThere is no inherent meaning in life.\n\nAll you can do is assign meaning.\n\nAs long as the meaning you choose isn’t destructive to yourself or society, you don’t owe anyone an explanation for why you live the way you do.\n\nAnd while I want to impact the world, I always believe it starts with family, friends, and then gradually expanding outward.\n\nThis reminds me of a powerful quote:\n\n*\"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.\"* — Steve Jobs\n\nSo, what's your dream life? \n\nI challenge you to define it in one line (and please don't forget to have fun).",

      "body": "Hey r/selfimprovement,\n\nI wanted to address an issue on this subreddit that seems to be affecting a lot of young people out there - attaching one's self-worth to whether or not you have a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or have had sex.\n\nSociety often puts an immense amount of pressure on people to achieve these milestones as a measure of their worth, but it's essential to understand that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history.\n\n1. **You are a complete person on your own:** It's essential to remember that you are a whole, unique, and valuable individual, regardless of whether you have a partner or not. Your worth is not determined by someone else's presence in your life. Embrace your individuality and work on building a strong, independent identity.\n2. **Focus on personal growth:** Instead of focusing on finding a partner or engaging in sexual activities, shift your focus to personal growth. Invest time in your education, career, hobbies, and personal interests. Work on becoming the best version of yourself, and you'll naturally attract people who appreciate you for who you are.\n3. **Develop healthy relationships:** Building and maintaining strong friendships is crucial for a fulfilling life. Establish meaningful connections with people who share your values and support your growth. Genuine friendships can provide emotional support and bring happiness to your life, regardless of your relationship status.\n4. **Mental and emotional well-being:** Attaching your self-worth to relationships and sex can lead to anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem. It's essential to recognize that your mental and emotional well-being is a priority. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed.\n5. **Understand that relationships are not a solution:** It's a common misconception that having a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or engaging in sexual activities will solve your problems or make you happy. However, relationships come with their own challenges, and it's crucial to recognize that happiness comes from within.\n6. **Patience and timing:** It's important to understand that everyone's journey is different. You may find a partner or engage in sexual activities at a different time than your peers, and that's okay. Life isn't a race, and you should focus on building a life you're proud of, rather than comparing yourself to others.\n7. **Embrace vulnerability and emotional intelligence:** One of the most attractive qualities a person can possess is emotional intelligence. Learn to express your emotions, be empathetic, and communicate effectively. Being vulnerable and emotionally intelligent will lead to deeper, more meaningful connections with others.\n\nIn conclusion, remember that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history. Focus on personal growth, establish healthy relationships, and prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. By doing so, you'll create a fulfilling life and attract the right people into it.",

      "body": "\"Hey, the general manager wants to see you in his office'\" is rarely something that a guy on the bottom of the totem pole wants to hear.  This is what was told to me when I was a lot porter at the Porsche dealership that I worked at.  Basically I washed the cars, swept the floor, took out the trash, and just made sure the dealership looked good.  I had no seniority or subordinates and was definitely the lowest paid.\n\nWhen dusting off the showroom cars, where insurance alone is 2-months pay for me, I bumped into a gentleman that used to work there and we struck up a conversation.  He asked what I did and I said  \"ahhh, I'm just a lot porter here. It's a good job for a college kid, but nothing too flashy.\"  We parted ways and I continued on with my day.  A few hours late I'm being summoned to the general managers office.\n\nHe sat me down and said that he just got done talking to a good friend of his, the same man I conversed with earlier.  Then he said \"You know, I heard something very alarming from him. He told me that you said you were 'just a lot porter.' Is that true?\"  I told him yes.  He then told me something that I have never forgotten.  He said \"Look, you're not 'just' anything.  You're a lot porter, not just, not only, you're a lot porter and you're just as, if not more, valuable to this team than the guys selling the cars. I see you every day making sure this place looks sharp, and without that, these sales guys don't sell anything. If the cars are dusty, or theres dirt on the floor, they are going somewhere else. And we all know that they are going to be dusting the cars.  You're not 'just' a lot porter, remember that.\"\n\nI've never forgotten that, and to this day I've caught others with the similar thought.  So, if you are using the word \"just\" in front of your job description, I'd encourage you to drop that part.  You're needed in your position, and not \"just\" anything.  If your position was that irrelevant it would most likely be automated.\n\nAll this said, there's something to be said about toxic environments, being happy in a position, morale, or the many other reasons why you're dissatisfied with your position.  Those are all important topics, but just for your own sake, don't' use \"just\" anymore, and for those who are in leadership positions, don't use it to describe your subordinate positions either.\n\nI hope this serves you and those you work for, alongside, and over.  It has served me many times over and has brightened both my self-pride and worth as well as those whom I have had the pleasure to lead.",

      "body": "Hey all, I chose to study psychology as a reaction to me being depressed and going to therapy at my lowest point. The combination of both helped me leave my depression behind. These lessons gave me a new life. Hope it does the same to some of you:\n\n1. Your brain lies to you constantly You're not a passive observer of reality, you are a narrator. Your brain invents stories that feel true,  but often are built on cognitive bias,  emotional residue, and past wounds.\n\n2 is \"what you avoid controls you\"  \nAvoidance feels like relief in the short term,  but every time you dodge discomfort,  you strengthen fear, shame, procrastination, or resentment.\n\n3. You are not who you think you are.  \nYou're who you are. Practice being. Identity isn't a fixed thing. It's a feedback loop of habits, roles, beliefs,  and repeated stories. You shape who you are by what you do over and over, not who you wish you were.\n\n4. You are wired for emotion, but built to regulate it.  \nFeeling your emotions is not enough. Mental health comes from being able to name, hold, and use your emotions, not being hijacked by them.\n\nWhich one do you like most? And if you have any actionable tips related to these, feel free to share them in the comments. I'll do the same.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nEdit, since so many asked and my comment with my learnings how to turn these \"theoretical\" concepts into action got buried a bit in the comments, adding them here again:\n\n1. I feel like it's a bit easier with emotions. It's harder with opinions we made, because an opinion is a combination of tons of things we read and our brain kinda just saves what supports the pre-made opinion. I think this is called confirmation bias. But what you can always do is, when you are really certain of something: Asking yourself 'where does this feeling/opinion come from', and how can I find arguments that support the complete opposite way. Kinda dismantling your belief pillars and then trying to dismantle them to get a different perspective\n\n2. Doing stuff that you don't feel like doing is hard. Everything I learned about how to do it anyways, I learnt from B.J Fogg, his book Tiny Habits is a masterpiece\n\n3. Be - do - have. Who do you wanna be? How do they act = do? Do it and you'll have what they have. Identity is what you do and how you think of yourself. So for me it was acting + self-worth.\n\n4. Make emotions work for you, not against you. Luckily we grab our phone every time we are running away from something \"negative\" inside of us. I'm using the Lemio app to block social media apps and every time I end up there, I can use it as a trigger moment to reverse-engineer my emotions. Can recommend the RAIN framework to do so",

Self-care should not be something we resort to because we are so absolutely exhausted that we need some reprieve from our own relentless internal pressure.\n\nTrue self-care is not salt baths and chocolate cake, it is making the choice to build a life you don’t need to regularly escape from.\n\nAnd that often takes doing the thing you least want to do.\n\nIt often means looking your failures and disappointments square in the eye and re-strategizing. It is not satiating your immediate desires. It is letting go. It is choosing new. It is disappointing some people. It is making sacrifices for others. It is living a way that other people won’t, so maybe you can live in a way that other people can’t.\n\nIf you find yourself having to regularly indulge in consumer self-care, it’s because you are disconnected from actual self-care, which has very little to do with “treating yourself” and a whole lot do with parenting yourself and making choices for your long-term wellness.\n\nIt means being the hero of your life, not the victim. It means rewiring what you have until your everyday life isn’t something you need therapy to recover from. It is no longer choosing a life that looks good over a life that feels good. It is giving the hell up on some goals so you can care about others. It is being honest even if that means you aren’t universally liked. It is meeting your own needs so you aren’t anxious and dependent on other people.\n\nIt is becoming the person you know you want and are meant to be.

      "body": "Introverts typically prefer interacting with smaller numbers of people rather than large groups, take more time to open up to strangers, and don’t mind being alone as much.\n\nAlthough it sounds contradictory, introverts can be outgoing. Being outgoing means being friendly, initiating an interaction with someone in a positive manner, a trait not solely reserved for extroverts. Although it may not come as naturally and requires more work to get into that mindset, an introvert can be just as charming when interacting with a stranger out in public. As mentioned previously, being introverted often means being more at ease being alone, which is powerful and is the biggest deterrent against neediness.\n\nOn the other hand, being shy is the biggest impediment to being good with women, or with people in general. It doesn’t matter if you are handsome, jacked, wearing amazing clothes. If you cannot hold a conversation,or are constantly feeling insecure, you don’t have a chance out there.Being shy means being closed off, emotionally defensive, self-conscious, and fearful of the opinions of others. It is rooted in the fear of rejection.\n\nThere is no magic solution to prevent shyness and build self-confidence. It is different for everyone. Therapy, group activities, saying hello (not creepily) to strangers when out, working out are actions to consider.\n\nHowever, the most important thing to remember is that being shy is not a static quality that only introverts exhibit. It may require more initial discomfort,but introverts are just as capable of being attractive and socially competent as an extrovert.",

They are most often met with high levels of both praise and criticism, whether it’s deserved or not.\n\nThe U.S. President, arguably the most powerful person in the world, is in most cases on both ends of the spectrum for public opinion—they are either reviled, or treated like almost like a living god in some instances. Political bias plays a large role in this, but nonetheless is an example.\n\nThe same approach applies to women. Men who get friend-zoned or not viewed as a potential romantic partner often aren’t polarizing. They are afraid to be sexual, to potentially be offensive, to disagree. Instead of being themselves, they would rather please than encounter potential conflict.\n\nThe internal characteristics that women find most attractive—confidence, boldness, humor, independence of thought—are impossible to achieve if the man is unwilling to stick his neck out and be potentially disagreeable in some way.\n\nSome women will think you’re a dream man, others will think you’re a corny piece of shit and want nothing to do with you.\n\nIf you blend in the background for the sake of being liked, both of those groups of women may view you as a pleasant buddy or friend, but neither will view you in a sexual manner.\n\nWould you rather have most women like you as a platonic friend, or have a good portion of women view you in a romantic/sexual manner, if it means others will reject or dislike you?\n\nThe more success you have, there will be more people that dislike or hate you, and there is nothing you can do. As long as your actions are authentic, and you have a genuine concern for other’s well being, and act on it to the best of your ability, hate shouldn’t bother you.\n\nPress on, be bold. Be willing to be disliked.",

If someone can't tell you their flaws, they have a dangerous lack of self-awareness.\n\n5. Just because a relationship has lasted a long time doesn't mean it's working.\n\n6. Self-respect comes from self-control.\n\nYou'll never respect yourself if you're a slave to people pleasing and external validation.\n\n7. Don't let your time and energy leak from social media, overthinking, and meaningless relationships.\n\n8. If you always think your happiness is somewhere else, it'll never be where you are.\n\n9. Life doesn't wait for you to be okay. Get up every day and keep pushing through.\n\n10. Free yourself from society's advice, most of them have no idea of what they're doing.\n\n11. Hit at least 200 pushups and 100 squats per day to stay strong. You'll also be healthier than 97% of people.\n\n12. Make the internet a source of your income.

      "body": "For decades I lived a life of a begging fool. While I didn't literally beg people for the things I wanted from them, they innevitably felt it.\n\nThey saw it in my face. Deep inside of me, I was desperate. The way I looked at them, the way I talked to them, the weakness that was conveyed simply by framing things in a specific way.\n\nNobody wants to invest in somebody (romance, business, friendship), that gives us \"beta vibes\". While this term seems shallow, it has a deep biological significance. No matter how amazing you think you are, if you make people feel like they’re about to lose something by choosing you, they’ll walk away every time.\n\nAnd losing can be interpreted in many ways. Reputational loss, attractivity loss, financial loss, loss of power, ... everybody has unique causes for not doing what we want them to do (despite the sale itsself).\n\nSo one day, this has changed for me. I met this one person that turned my life upside down. Until that day, there was an invisible sign on my forehead which stated \"please accept me, please love me, please don't reject me.\"\n\nThis person was the complete opposite. This person conveyed \"I am worthy, no matter what you think of me, what do you bring to the table for my time and love? I seek rejection, because that makes me grow and worst case sort out the wrong people\".\n\nUntil today, I believe this is the biggest multiplicator for success or failure in life and especially business. It's the invisible statements, which we convey simply by the way we phrase things, look at people and think about ourselves.",

      "body": "A few years ago, I thought I was doing everything right. I was hitting the gym consistently, getting stronger, pushing myself physically. I liked the feeling of progress - knowing that if I put in the work, I’d get results. It was simple: lift, eat, rest, repeat. And over time, I could see and feel the difference.\n\nBut outside the gym? That was a different story.\n\nI remember the first time I tried to approach and ask someone out in real life. My heart was pounding. My throat got dry. And when I finally worked up the nerve to say something, it felt like my brain stopped working. She gave me a polite but uninterested response, and I walked away feeling like I had just been hit by a truck. And that feeling stuck with me for weeks.\n\nIt made me realize something. Physically, I was strong. But mentally? I was weak.\n\nI had spent years training my body, but I had never trained my ability to handle rejection, to stay calm under pressure, or to push through discomfort when it really mattered. And that’s when I realized that confidence and mental toughness weren’t things you just *had*. They were things you *built*, just like muscle.\n\nSo I decided to treat approaching strangers like a gym for my mind. Instead of avoiding awkward moments or fearing rejection, I started seeing them as reps. Every approach, every conversation, even every failure - it was all part of the training. And just like in the gym, the more I showed up, the stronger I got.\n\nAt first, it was brutal. I’d have days where nothing seemed to go right. But over time, I started handling rejection without flinching. I got comfortable under pressure. And eventually, I reached a point where confidence wasn’t something I had to think about - it was just there.\n\nLooking back, I realize most people do what I did at the start. They train their body but completely neglect their mind. They think confidence is just about looking good or being in shape, but when it comes time to actually put themselves out there, they crumble. And it’s not because they’re broken - it’s because they’ve never trained for it.\n\nSo if you’re someone who’s serious about growth, ask yourself: are you only working out physically, or are you also training your mental toughness? Because if you want real confidence - the kind that lasts - you can’t just lift weights. You have to \"lift discomfort\" too.\n\nFor me, my mental gym changed everything. Maybe it could for you too.",

If you’re trying to change your behavior, habit, yourself and most importantly your life but you’re not aware of what’s getting you stuck, you won’t change.

He's extremely intelligent and well-spoken, he has a stable job (which he just got promoted to), he has a large group of friends who come over every weekend, he plays the piano better than I've ever heard, he gets up at 7 and goes to bed at 10, he prays and meditates in the mornings, he does all his chores on time with no exceptions, he's a fantastic cook and he exercises routinely and expresses his emotions in a healthy way. He's only three years older than me, but I feel like a teenager in comparison.\n\nI never even realized just how bad I was at life in general until I met this guy. The other day, he took me aside and asked me if I was okay, because he thought I might be depressed.

We fantasize about a life with them and our perception of their good and bad traits are misaligned with reality. Putting it simply, shit gets too serious, too soon.\n\nIf you are invested too heavily in someone, and they aren’t as receptive, it’s easy to fall into the trap of chasing this person, or an idealized version you have of them in your head.\n\nIf you are on this path, visualize yourself over the next few years being devoted to this person who does not value you. Imagine yourself finally coming out of the fog, while they’ve disposed of you emotionally long before.\n\nThink of all the amazing people you could have met, the happiness and emotional freedom you could have enjoyed in that time period.\n\nIt’s a cliche, but time is precious.

      "body": "I have a part time job working at a pizza place. My boss is an 80+ year old guy, he ran the place with his wife his whole life and this past year she recently got sick with cancer. He runs the place pretty much by himself now, he’s there every single day from open to close. I’ve never seen him not there. How he manages this? Idk. He has arthritis and you can see hes in pain, physically, emotionally etc. I could see the sadness inside him during the days, when he takes breaks, it seems like he’s just thinking about what used to be, or thinking about when things were better.\n\nToday he walked into the kitchen as I was working and told me he’d do anything to be my age again. You hear that all the time from old people but the way he said it to me really penetrated. It kinda made me think about how lucky I am. Often times we kinda just drift through life without taking a second to appreciate our youth, our abilities, the things we take for granted. I’m not perfect by any means and tend to go through depressive periods like everyone, but this almost makes me feel\nGuilty for not taking full advantage of my youth. One day this will all be over, we all have a due date, so I guess I’m going to try and think about this whenever I feel down or feel pain, etc. Just a little message / lesson from today I thought I’d share.",

We have grown up seeing our father go to an office we have never seen, come back tired, go to sleep and repeat the cycle next day. Most of us have never seen what our fathers do.\n\nIt isn't glamorous working a 9 to 5 job, it leaves little time for friends or for any other interests. Our fathers are lonely and alone, they have given their 20s, their 30s , their 40s and their 50s to working day in and day out. If you have had the privilege of having a father who never abused you, pushed you ahead and made sure that you had education, internet , clothing and security , know that to give you all of this he had to give up a lot. It has become almost a trend to insult our fathers in the self improvement community as being weak for never having reached an incredible degree of success, for not having been the ideal man we can model ourselves after, but our fathers entered the world alone and gave you everything. Our fathers never cried about the lives they had, our fathers chose to walk to work so that they can save up for our birthday, our fathers have given up their joys to ensure we can have ours.\n\nBefore they had children to take care of, or a marriage or anything for that matter, they were very similar to you. They were artists, musicians, athletes , writers, philosophers and they might have dreamt of giving their lives to one of these arts. They chose stable but draining, monotonous jobs to give you a good life. For the young men out there, grow out of the resentment you have for your father for never being there, appreciate your father. They might not become the incredible artists or athletes they could have once been but they should not be lonely and unappreciated. Show interest in them, learn their knowledge, give them a chance to relive the joys they had long given up. Your father has been waiting for the day he gets to show you what he knows and what he loves, don't make him wait longer.",

There are usually about 70 attendees. I have to create the agenda, make sure everyone can connect, and be the primary presenter and facilitator of discussions.\n\nIt was really uncomfortable at first. I’m sure my first several meetings were not smooth, but over time it improved and now I feel confident every time I lead these type of meetings. I still make minor mistakes from time to time, but I’ve learned to have a sense of humor about it.\n\nThis confidence has carried over into my social life as well. No matter how small, find opportunities wherever you can to consistently take on leadership roles and get outside your comfort zone.\n\nVolunteer, lead your sports team, come up with activities for your social group, request to take on additional leadership assignments at work. Even if these are small, the confidence of stepping outside your comfort zone and leading other people will impact other areas of your life, including your social life.\n\nYou will be more assured, a better communicator, and not be as needy and willing to please others.

      "title": "Whenever you say yes to something you don’t want, you’re saying no to something you want.",
      "body": "My whole life I’ve been concerned about how people  perceive me. I want to be liked, loved, and accepted. This is a human need since we are social creatures. Having experienced my fair share of abandonment, loss, and grief in my life at an early age, I developed some thought patterns that thought these needs weren’t being met so I clung to the need even more and molded myself into taking action that I thought everyone wanted me to take instead of what I actually wanted. \n\nI constantly agreed to things that I didn’t want to do out of fear that I would be abandoned once again, if even only in the thoughts of other people thinking that I wasn’t lovable or likable because I wasn’t doing what they wanted of me. \n\nThis trend continued in my life in so many ways, I’d mold my personality, appearance, desires, paths, all in the name of being acceptable in someone else’s opinion. \n\nOne day, I finally cracked. Beaten down by an adderall addiction, voluntary starvation, at a job I hated, a college major I despised, in a fake relationship I thought was the best thing I had going for me, I existed as a hollow shell who didn’t know who she was. \n\nThere had to be another way. \nSo I had to flip my life as I knew it upside and do everything I thought I shouldn’t do so I could finally find myself once again. \n\nOne of the common habits I’ve always had is saying yes to what I don’t want to do because it’s what someone else wants from me. I didn’t realize, though, that every-time I did that, I was actually saying no to something for me. If I spend my time doing something I don’t want to do with resentfulness, I say no to the time I could be spending doing something for myself and my own inner peace. This also applies to things that have absolutely nothing to do with others such as my own thoughts or actions.\n\nThis morning I set my silent alarm for 5:55 and an actual sound one for 6:30 because I wanted to go running before work. I went running on Monday too, and that was the first time I did so in months. I woke up the earliest I have in so long on Monday and the whole day I was grounded and confident and felt good. Since I had been dealing with a lot of anxious thoughts the last few months, I knew something had to change so I took control of what I could. \n\nWhen the 5:55 alarm went off I debated getting up at the moment but didn’t. Then the sound alarm rang and I immediately had the thought, “if I say yes to staying in bed, what am I saying no to?” This was a surprising thought because it’s not one that every really came up before immediately at 6:30AM but I also feel it’s just proof of the inner shift through thought work and self-improvement that are sticking. I was saying no to doing something good for my body (yoga and running), I was saying no to feeling accomplished, I was saying no to alone time which is rare since my boyfriend and I both work at home and we don’t do anything because of covid so time by myself is harder to come by these days. I was saying no to all of these wonderful things compared to saying yes to staying in bed which is what I did for the past few months and it didn’t make me feel good when I just ignored my alarm or internal clock that woke me up but I decided to sleep and ended up more groggy and just rolling out of bed right before I had to sign on for work. \n\nSo saying yes to something you don’t want to do becomes more of an obvious issue when you think of what you’re giving up. Opportunity costs I guess for my business people. They’re real and they impact our lives in many ways. I thought I was doing good deeds when I said yes to something I didn’t want to do but truthfully I was also saying yes to resentment and saying no to so many other things that would be better use of my time & energy which are our most important resources. \n\nI invite you to ask yourself next time you feel an “obligation” to say yes in order to please someone else, what’s the cost? What are you saying no to? Making informed decisions instead of ones out of fear of rejection or abandonment has been such an important tool for me on this journey. I’m not perfect at it, but I know every time I evaluate this, I feel a million times better because I usually end up choosing the one that is best for me.",

They’re “normal.”\n\nHere’s what they look like:\n\nPorn  \nSocial media  \nCasual sex with no presence  \nDopamine-scrolling  \nValidation from strangers\n\nVideo games that replace purpose  \nOutrage addiction  \nProcessed food for emotional comfort  \nSelf-help loops that replace real action\n\nNone of them look dangerous.  \nBut all of them quietly **reprogram your brain** and **disconnect you from yourself**.\n\nYou stop needing heroin when TikTok gives you 100 hits an hour.  \nYou stop needing a bottle when a stranger’s like or a new girl’s/ boy's attention floods your ego.  \nYou stop needing truth when performance gets applause.\n\nThese are drugs.  \nAnd the scariest part?\n\n**They don’t kill you fast.**  \n**They just keep you “okay” enough to never wake up.**\n\nYou don’t even know what’s missing—until you go without them for a while and remember what silence, clarity, and depth feel like.\n\nThe real war isn’t against hard drugs anymore.  \nIt’s against **soft addictions that pretend to be normal.**\n\nAnd the people who beat them?  \nThey don’t look high-achieving.  \nThey look **awake**.\n\nWhat’s the softest drug that hooked you the hardest?\n\n(edit)\n\nI wanted to add a little since everybody is complaining about the use of Chatgpt in this post.  \nFirst of all: Thats not what this post is about, everybody is just dodging the point that I'm trying to make (which in my opinion is agreeing).  \nI use Chatgpt for sure, I use it to sharpen my thoughts, idea's and theories about myself and life. When I come to a certain conclusion or insight I like, I reshape it and post it. But since everybody hates it, here is raw version:\n\nSociety and law are lagging behind when it comes to technology. We don't understand one bit of what it tech does to our mind, so its all legal. I'm making the comparison to substances think of: concaine, weed, heroin, amphetamines etc etc. Those substances also were legal at one point in time. Until we realized what it did to our brains.\n\nThe time we live in now has new drugs that we also don't fully understand yet. But is is fucking with the same receptors in our head (this is a guess).  \nThe internet is still a wild west without restrictions on drugs. But the drugs I see are:  \n\\- Tiktok shorts  \n\\- Porn  \n\\- Videogames  \n\\- Hookup culture/casual sex  \n\\- External validation (likes, carreer bs, status, etc)\n\nThese things fuck up your brain and personality, just the way drugs do.  \nyou can't OD on these things, they kill your mind not your body.  \nYou are lost and can't see clearly anymore.  \nYou can't think for yourself anymore.  \nYour brain craves stimulation  \nYou can't stand silences  \nTo name some\n\nAnd beating these things does not mean you becoming rich.  \nIt just means you become awake and live life for real.",

      "body": "And that is: **Stop. Overcomplicating. Stuff.** \n\nIt might sound simplistic or dumb, but once you actually apply it to your daily life, I can guarantee you that it's gonna be much better. I'm not even talking about just \"overthinking\" here, let me present you an example:\n\nA friend of mine wanted to get in shape last year. She started researching training and nutritional methods, bought tons of expensive activewear and then signed up for one of the best (and therefore, most expensive) gyms of our area. By the time she stepped her foot for the first time inside that gym, she had already spent a lot of time, money and mental/physical effort, just to prepare for the possibility of going to the gym. A couple of weeks later she had already started skipping workouts, until she completely gave up a few weeks later, realizing that gym wasn't really her thing.\n\nObviously doing research and being prepared is a good thing. But the best approach for me would be to **start doing stuff and then putting the effort**, instead of the opposite (that my friend did). If you want to get in shape, simply start eating more stuff that everyone knows they're healthier (fruits, vegetables, boiled eggs, chicken etc), cut out all the stuff that everyone knows they're not the best (fast food, chocolates, beer, soda) and then simply start moving your body. Every time you think about getting in shape, maybe do 5 push-ups. Try to aim for 10. If you can do 10, aim for 15 and so on. If you have a park with some pull-up bars nearby, go there and try to see how many you can do or for how many seconds you can hang with your hands without falling. If you have a dog, start going for longer or more regular walks. You get the point by now, do the simple stuff. Once you reach that \"level\", then try thinking about the gym, more complex workouts and getting the most expensive Nike and Gymshark outfits. If you are not an active person, you won't simply start working out everyday and even if you do, chances are you'll give up soon, like my friend. Smaller steps = huge success imo.",

      "body": "For most of my life, I've been convinced that I don't work the same way as other people in that I'll never become good at anything even if I spend time on it. I think being shitty at sports as a kid kinda fucked me up later in life by ensuring I would never spend too much time doing anything so that I would never have to be let down if I didn't make any progress. Another habit I started picking up (mainly as a defense mechanism) was that if I spent more time reading about an activity than actually doing it, I could convince myself that I was being productive and actually working towards something. This was a dangerous mindset to get into because 1) it caused to me feel a sense of accomplishment in the short term without having anything to actually show for it and 2) it intensified my feelings of personal disappointment when I DID manage to attempt something new and find out that I'm not very good at it, leading me to sink back into my \"reading and not doing\" state. It all starts to turn into this vicious cycle of picking things up and immediately putting them down, fulfilling my own prophecy of never being good at anything. \n\nSo now I'm age 30 and we've been in the middle of a pandemic for a year where I've had a lot of time to reflect and work on myself. I've been forcing myself to get over my fear of sucking at things and just start doing them regardless in the hope that I'll eventually start seeing improvements over time. It really sucks to see how much further ahead my friends are when it comes to their hobbies and skills, but I'm becoming a bit more hopeful every day that I can get to that level if I just put the time into the things I wanna get better at every day, (NOT just reading about them) even if there are days where I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.

      "body": "I've experimented a bit over the past 6 months with various ways to cut back on doom scrolling. I came across a few reddit posts that inspired me to try things like a 24-hour detox, or even 10 days cutting back. It worked, but then my screen time tended to fluctuate a lot afterwards.\n\nI saw some posts about the idea of a 30 day plan. Having 4 separate weekly plans made it more digestible.   \n  \nI have seen a few posts that have referenced similar techniques lately so wanted to expand a bit and share my experience in case it's helpful. Random Redditors have given me pretty good inspiration on this topic to make changes so maybe I can do the same.   \n\n\n**This was my strategy:**\n\n\\- First, each Sunday I would pick out a few productive things for the week that I would use to replace my mindless scrolling and track it (ex: reading, steps walked, calls made to family, etc). Then the next Sunday I'd review what I accomplished with that time and revamp the plan (was very motivating and eye opening).\n\n\\- The second part of the strategy was adding a lot of friction to my phone usage. I know if I don't have boundaries I'll slip. \n\n**Week 1:**  \n\\- 25 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock as many times as I want for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 120 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Used grayscale manually\n\n\\- Result: 7 hrs/day, 123 pickups/day (7 hours gained)\n\n**Week 2:**  \n\\- 20 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock as many times as I want for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 100 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Used grayscale manually\n\n\\- Result: 5.5 hrs/day, 102 pickups/day (17 hours gained)\n\n**Week 3:**  \n\\- 10 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock 3x for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 75 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Set up grayscale to kick in automatically at sunset\n\n\\- Result: 3.5 hrs/day, 77 pickups/day (30 hours gained)\n\n**Week 4:**  \n\\- 5 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (no unblocking allowed)  \n\\- Target of 50 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Grayscale to kick in automatically at sunset\n\n\\- Result: 2 hrs/day, 55 pickups/day (42 hours gained)  \n\\- The week 4 set up is my plan for all of 2025  \n\n\n**As for how it changed my life...**\n\nThe amount of time I've unlocked is staggering.  I feel like I'm not constantly working from behind for the first time in a long time...\n\nOne of the biggest changes was I feel like I have more \"space\" in my day to day life. I don't feel like I'm in a constant state of elevated anxiety... I don't think I realized how much the phone time was contributing to that. \n\nI definitely have more energy (part of that is also because it helps me sleep better when I'm not so wired up from habitually checking my phone).\n\nI'm getting more done in a focused and productive way than before. One symptom of using my phone like I did was I always bounced around from task to task instead of going into deeper focus. I feel like one hour of work without checking my phone is worth 4 hours when I'm distracted. \n\nI also feel like I get more pleasure from the little things now.\n\nSo the combination of more time, lower stress, and better productivity nets out to a pretty big impact on my life.  \n\n\n**Last note, a few disclaimers:**\n\n\\- I honestly don't know exactly what dopamine detox means... to me I think if it as getting away from the \"cheap dopamine\" that I get from constantly scrolling and checking my phone and making more space for dopamine from real-life activities that give me pleasure. I'm not a scientist so maybe it's better to just call it a phone detox, but dopamine is interesting as a way to get the point across... \n\n\\- I don't post that often on reddit but when I do I give myself a day or two of more than usual usage to try to engage with y'all in the comments (but only comment or post from a computer, and not my phone)",

      "body": "There was an interesting experiment concerning workers who weren't saving up enough money for their retirement. The researches made them visualise their future self, which included everything from digital visualisation to writing letters \"to myself in 20 years\".\n\nThese people started saving up a lot more than before. And the scientists were like, ahh the reason we don't care about our future self is that it's too abstract! We literally can't connect to it without some hardcore computer stimulation. Great work guys, problem solved.\n\nSo, today I was thinking about every time I self-sabotaged in the past. Everything from binge watching a show instead of sleeping to that one time I didn't submit my Master's thesis on time, which set me back about 2 years.\n\nAnd I realised, it's not that I didn't care for my future self. I love my future self. I always imagine her to be way more together than I am now, and also wise and successful. Possibly looking great for a middle aged woman.\n\nBut then, there's the past self. What I realised today, my relationship with her is much worse and that often comes up when I'm about to make an important decision. Like with that Master's thesis - I hated myself for procrastinating the previous year, so I kept on procrastinating. **Because working hard would be an act of self love, and all I felt was self hate.**\n\nSo the future self suffered. I still suffer the consequences in some ways actually, though it's been 5 years. I AM that future self. Hello.\n\nMeanwhile, what is the past self doing?\n\nShe doesn't exist. Unlike the future self, which does. In some ways she's more real than the present self (Zen masters would disagree).\n\nSo I guess my conclusion is, the best thing we can do for ourselves is forgive and forget the past self, let her go, and do something wholesome right now.",

It can be simple. \r\n\r\nNow believe me, I have incredible empathy for anyone who feels unconfident in themselves when it comes to their social/dating lives, and is currently putting a lot of mental energy into this area of their life. I've been there, and I know how demotivating it can be to feel like you're an awkward person or that you're a burden on the people around you.\r\n\r\nNow what I did to overcome the problems in my confidence was… \r\n\r\n>> I let my fear tell me what actions I should take \r\n\r\nThe more I was afraid to do something, the bigger the indication that I needed to do that thing (as long as it wouldn't put my or someone else's life at risk of course, let's not get silly here lol).\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to approach strangers, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to pick up a phone call, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to socialize in group settings, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\n-The more I was afraid to be vulnerable and go on dates, the more I had to do it\r\n\r\nOnce, I was at my friend's mom's funeral, and the time came where we were asked if we wanted to share any words about her with the group. I obviously wanted to, but I felt a great fear inside my chest-- I didn't want to look stupid in front of everyone.\r\n\r\nBut I remembered this rule that I set for myself, and because I was afraid, I went up anyway. I began weeping in front of everyone as I recounted a story of us during my childhood. My friend started weeping as well-- it meant the world to him.\r\n\r\nBecoming comfortable with the uncomfortable is how you can truly become a confident person.\r\n\r\nI hope this inspires you to take action. As cliché as it sounds: if there is fear, you have to face it. \r\n\r\nOkay, if you need more help with your social/dating life, reach out to me. I try to help as many people as I can, so just explain what is going on for you and we can see if I can help.\r\n\r\nChef kiss!",

      "body": "It's kind of a vicious circle. You are afraid of something and so you avoid doing it. Because you didn't do it, you give yourself the signal that it's very hard for you to do it and so you get a little bit more anxious. The next time you're in the same situation you are a little bit more afraid and so you avoid it again which starts the circle again.\n\nWhat I found out to be very effective is, that we actively WANT to expose ourselves to situations that are frightening to us. I know that for a lot of us it's too overwhelming to just go out and talk to someone. But you don't have to jump into the cold water right away, you can also MENTALLY prepare yourself for it by feeling your anxiety and getting to know it. Your brain can't tell the difference between a real situation or the pictures you make in your head, that's why mentally exposing yourself to situations where you feel anxiety is so effective. Because what we are often afraid of is not the situation but more the feeling of anxiety itself. So we are anxious about being anxious. If we apply a mindfulness practice for example and learn to feel the anxiety when it comes up, we slowly but surely break the circle. \n\nHope that helps you ❤️",

      "body": "I've learnt this lesson in a really hard way. Since childhood, I would do things that I excelled at and avoid the ones that I wasn't the best at. This worked out well in school where I did well academically compared to my peers. But once I went to college, I was surrounded with people who were much better than me at everything. I was having a hard time keeping up classes. I started getting anxiety issues and my academics started worsening. This drove me futher into depression. It took me months to get out of it. Similar episodes happened to me later when my life didn't go on the track that I had planned. Job rejections, a break-up, etc. Each time my world would come crashing down on me and I would feel that this is the end of my life as I've known it. I found it so difficult to cope up with a life different from what I had planned and a life where things aren't always perfect. It drove me to suicidal thoughts because I thought a life less than perfect is not worth living. \n\nI don't know how long I will continue struggling with this habit of mine. But if you have kids who are over-achievers in childhood, I would urge you to make them take up a few activities which they are not the best at. This will help them learn how to cope up with failures, rejections and undesired outcomes.",

We’d been together for 7 years and obviously the breakup was devastating. \n\nBut about a month after we broke up I just saw my filthy apartment, my left over Uber eats bags stacking up, I saw my figure which I’d been letting go steadily for years. I saw my unwashed bedding, filthy carpet, untidy desk, and I realised that it didn’t look that much different from when we’d been living together. I realised that he’d been keeping me back, making me feel terrible for being the breadwinner. \n\nHe stripped away the last money I had when we separated and I was down to my last few dollars. \n\nI suddenly started cleaning and I couldn’t stop. I was overwhelmed, possessed to clean and clean until everything was spotless. \n\nI started making my bed every day. Cooking all my food healthy, exercising, reading more, working harder at the office. \n\nI got a promotion, I’m getting my teeth fixed. I’m going to the gym 3 times a week. \n\nPeople say they don’t recognise me. I’m so insanely happy all the time. Even when work sucks and I’m dead tired I feel so secure and accomplished. It’s not a chore anymore, I’m just me, the best version of me. \n\nI take my depression medication every day and I genuinely think my depression is in remission. I’ve never felt this good in my life, just consistently happy for almost an entire year!!\n\nI’ve self improved 100% and I feel amazing. \n\nYou can do it, I know you can.

(Not because of him but because my own love for the thing)\n\nEvery three months I have to send him an email and briefly tell him if something important (like my address, phone number...) Changed. \nSo I did that yesterday telling him that I got accepted to the best university in my country into a biochemistry course, the same course and school he attended. \nAnd to be honest I little bit hoped he would reply with something at least slightly nice. \n\nHe replied calling me a Mr. instead of my name. Told me that I am not his son anymore and basically blamed the wole divorce on me in a long and hateful paragraph. \n\nI called my mom, shared the mail with my girlfriend, had it on the back of my mind the whole damn day... To be honest even after being physically and mentally abused for 6 years straight, getting sued by him multiple, literally watching trying to kidnap my 4yo sister, this still really hurts. And I don't even know why do I care so much. \n\nThe only thing I can do now is to cope in a healthy way... And this is what is this post about. I have decided to cope in a healthy and mature way this time. And even though my entire being literally just wants to get drunk and self harm I'm not going to do it:) \nI will visit my family instead, spend some extra time with my girlfriend and cat, get some quality alone time.. whatever just to relax and clear my head. \n\nSo fuck you dad, you won't get the best of me this time.",

This limiting mindset leads to neediness, a willingness to please, putting their partners on a pedestal, and other self-sabotaging behaviors.\n\nIf the relationship doesn’t work, someone in this frame of mind will waste precious time and opportunity on their ex, who either rejected them, or just simply isn’t compatible.\n\nThis flawed belief of ‘the one’ leads to fixation on an idealized, fantasy version of their ex, not the real person. That person’s negative qualities and the issues in the relationship are overlooked or ignored, because romantic hopes are being projected onto them, instead of realizing that things ended for a reason.\n\nDo not buy into the myth. There is not one single soulmate for everyone. Based purely on population numbers, there are a multitude of people that you would connect with. It’s tragic to see this opportunity traded in for fixation on an imagined, idealized version of someone.\n\nThe best relationships come when there is mutual prioritization. Trying to convince someone to take you back will typically yield the same results. For whatever reason, they felt they didn’t need you in their lives at some point, enough to cut things off. Even if you manage to win them back, they still inherently do not value you. Once the infatuation fades again, the same issues will typically come to the surface again.",

      "body": "All of us want to wake up with an abundance of energy and motivation. Everyone wants to have unlimited amounts of willpower and discipline. Yet, our lives do not always turn out to be that way. \n\nAs soon as we turn off our alarm clocks, we begin our mornings with social media and YouTube. After wasting 20 precious minutes, we get up, broken and sleepy. We rush to our bathroom to do our business, to rinse our faces and brush our teeth. We hastily make our breakfast which contains nothing except tons of carbs and unhealthy fats. We brew our cup of coffee and start to fill our bodies with rubbish. Another 20 minutes later and we gotta go to school/work where we spend 8 hours sitting. \n\nThis is the way most of us live. We crave change. We can feel that something isn’t right. However, are we ready to act on that? It’s not easy to refuse to eat hollow foods. It’s not easy to lay your phone aside and sleep. It’s not easy to go for a run. \n\nIf you are tired of seeking the perfect routine or habits, you’ve come to the right place. There will be no bullshit and there will be no controversial topics.  Spoiler alert! You already know most of the stuff I’m going to tell here. However, why the hell did you not implement it, huh? Reading my post won’t alter you. You need to actually commit to the habits I present here to perceive the tangible change. \n\n**Sleep.**\n\nIf your sleep schedule is fucked up and you have no desire to fix it, then you can go fuck yourself with your meditation, exercise and proper nutrition. \n\nI can’t emphasize how important this point. Without proper rest, your incredible diet or training will be almost useless. Your ability to remember and recall information will decrease dramatically and you will not live your life to the fullest. And that’s not everything. Sleep deprivation is a dangerous thing that can increase your chances of dying earlier than you expect. \n\n“But I don’t have time! I have to do my homework, hang out with my friends, and eat pizza”. Bullshit. How many hours do you spend on YouTube or social media? 3 hours? 4 hours? Well, then it’s time to set priorities, brother. Either your health or additional hours of scrolling through endless news feeds.\n\n**Diet.**\n\nStop eating junk. Stop eating shit for breakfast. Stop filling your stomach with garbage in the evening. Buy some veggies and fruit. Try to eat more protein and fibre. Don’t forget about the vitamins and essential metals. \n\nOnce a week or two weeks, allow yourself to eat some chocolate or crisps. Don’t be stupidly harsh. Your body won’t like it.\n\n**Exercise.**\n\nWalk, ride a bike, do some push-ups, just get your blood flowing, man. Don’t be afraid to experiment and change your routine sometimes as well. Instead of running, try to cycle. Instead of doing calisthenics, pay a visit to the gym or boxing class. \n\n“But if I do cardio and weights, I will burn all my muscles and become a skinny dog”\n\nAre you a professional athlete who is capable of becoming the best? Are you a man/woman who earns money from sports? No? Then why do you limit yourself to one sport? Your goal is to be healthy and vital, not to show off your six-pack to girls.\n\n**Reading.**\n\n>“My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer and I have my mind...and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge. That's why I read so much Jon Snow.”\n\nI like the way George R.R. Martin addresses this point. In the first book of his series The Song of Ice and Fire, he compares books to a whetstone. He is not lying. Many studies have been conducted by famous universities and they discovered the same thing.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you read. The process of deciphering symbols on paper is challenging for our brains. Don’t forget to mix it up and get out of your comfort zone occasionally. If you’ve been reading sci-fi for the past two months, pick up non-fiction or some kind of biography. \n\nReading books in a foreign language is an incredible way to increase the benefits of reading to their fullest. Your brain needs to accomplish more work and strain more. However, that’s a topic for another day.\n\n**Mediation.**\n\nAgain, so many studies have been conducted on this subject. And I’m sure that you’ve seen tons of articles and videos on YouTube about it.\n\nIn 20 minutes a day, you can improve your mood, fluid intelligence, focus, self-control, willpower, and other things. \n\nIf you only have spare 10-20 minutes, that is the best way you can spend them.\n\nI especially advise meditation to those who are suffering from anxiety disorders. It will do wonders for you.\n\n**Listening.**\n\nEven if what they are saying is wrong. Listen. Do not interrupt. Then, after they finished, ask them questions about their point of view. Try to walk in their shoes and understand the way they think. Maybe you don’t know or missing something. Perhaps you are mistaken and they are right. You won’t come to a conclusion with mere interruption and arguing. That’s another human being in front of you, not a monster who is trying to deceive you.\n\n**Progressive overload.**\n\nProgressive overload is a concept I took from the bodybuilding community. It’s a method of increasing your muscle size, strength, and endurance by gradually increasing the stress you put on your nervous and musculoskeletal systems. In other words, it means to progressively increase the difficulty of an exercise to stop yourself from hitting a plateau or doing what’s comfortable.\n\nIf you want to advance in this life. If you want to reach new heights. You gotta apply this technique. You are not going to create your dream body or a giant business by meditating and sitting on a couch.\n\nI challenge you to do at least one uncomfortable thing every single day and observe the way your life will transform.\n\nBy the way, don’t forget about **rest**. Every competent bodybuilder or athlete will tell you that growth doesn’t happen in the gym. It happens at home.\n\nReward yourself. Play video games. Sit on social media. Watch Minecraft videos on YouTube. Just, don’t allow those things to take over your schedule.\n\nThanks for reading this hell of a post.",

      "body": "“I’m a failure because I don’t have a good job. Because I haven’t found a special someone yet. Because my body isn’t the right shape. Because I’m poor. Who I am is not good enough.”\n\nWhy do so many people relate to those words? Why is the default mental narrative of so many people “I’m a failure and I have no hope of getting better”?\n\nWho put those poisonous words in your head? Who taught you to feel so much shame? I don’t think this is you. I think you’re trying to live someone else’s life, walk in someone else’s shoes and stumbling because they don’t fit right.\n\nBecause society has a lot of expectations about your life. Society has a scoring rubric about what a good career looks like, or a happy relationship, or a flawless body. Society projects a lot of ideals onto us about the “right life.” And I think you’re breaking your toes trying to fit into a shoe that was never made for you.\n\nI’m not trying to tell you that you’re a special star in your own way and you’re better than society’s stupid ideals. If you’re anything like me, you’ve got issues, you have scars, and there’s a lot you want to do better. And it’s good to try and get better. But you’re not going to go very far while you keep hobbling in that ridiculously poor fitting shoe.\n\nYou are not a failure just because you don’t fit the mold life tried to force onto you. Everyone has different experiences growing up, different skills, different passions, different fears. How insane is it that we could all turn out the same way? The mold society has is just a guide that helps society survive. \n\nIf everyone in a society tries to be healthy and climb the ladder at work then the society will have a good economy and prosper. That’s the point of the mold. It’s not designed to make you happy, it’s not designed with an individual in mind, and it is impossible that more than a handful of random people could fit it perfectly. That’s why we glorify workaholics and people that volunteer and successful entrepreneurs. These are all individuals that happen to benefit the economy or their community. Society teaches us to value the things that are good for society - not us.\n\nYou are not a failure. You are just trying to wear someone else’s shoes. So stop tearing yourself apart. Stop saying “I’m a failure because X” and ask if X is actually important to you or if society just said it was. Ask yourself what is really important to you, and focus on that. \n\nI spent so many nights hating myself because my career was mundane. I felt broken because I was introverted and didn’t like going out. I thought I was hideous and ugly because I didn’t have a six pack. I thought something was wrong with me because I didn’t know how to be what society wanted.\n\nThat’s horseshit. Working 80 hours a week isn’t actually important to me. Going to bars or clubs wasn’t important to me. And I could be perfectly healthy without having a six pack. So why did I treat those like failures? \n\nI don’t know you. I don’t know things about yourself you really want to change and which parts simply don’t match the blueprint society gave you. But I need you to think about it. I need you to ask yourself what is really important. Ask yourself who you want to be. Because society doesn’t know what is best for you. And life won’t get better until you figure that out for yourself.\n\nThe best you is someone who enjoys each day. Someone who doesn’t tear themselves apart because their values are different than society’s. Someone who learns what is important to them and tries to be a better version of themself - not someone who tries to be someone else.\n\nAccepting who you are doesn’t mean you’re perfect and shouldn’t try to improve. It just means **you’re not a failure for who you are today.** We’re all works in progress. And if we stop hating ourselves for 5 minutes we can look around and enjoy taking one step forward today even if there’s a lot of steps left. \n\nWhen you get to the end, it’s over. When you get to your last step you’re going to wish you had taken your time and smelled the roses along the way. You’re never going to be perfect. So don’t wish away the days that you’re getting better. Try to accept who you are and enjoy them. \n\nStop trying to live someone else’s life. This is your life, and you can’t get it back once it is gone.\n\nFurther reading: If this resonated with you then I highly recommend “The Alchemist” by Paulo Coelho. It’s a short novel about finding what is important to you, and it’s helped a lot of people disengage from the society life gave them that they never wanted. You will never be happy while living someone else’s life. Take off those horrible shoes. They’re causing you so much pain, you’ll go much farther when you live the life that fits you.",

Alot of gym rats have bulking seasons that go astray. The biggest guys in the gym don't do cardio either, infact they'd struggle just as much as a overweight person on a tredmil. \n\nEven if you are visually obviously, blatantly unathletic, if you're really unfit you have the capacity to achieve something universally respected above all else in the gym scene. Alot of gym rats have been into sports from a young age and have never had to loose excessive weight, and honestly? Wouldn't have the mental will power if they were in the position of a overweight person. The fight that you're fighting is harder then what a already athletic person is facing and we all recognise that.  \n\nWhen you're overweight and you turn up, that is way more impressive then some chronically lean prodigy who's been born and raised an athlete. You're turning up out of grit and discipline, I'm turning up because the gym is a big play ground to me. Our work ethics arnt the same and I know that. Alot of gym rats are fighting for their lives to even loose 5% of their body fat. And then you come in and loose 20%? Gym rats are struggling in healthy bodies to stay disciplined and you turn up despite health issues and blow everyone out the water? You should be proud to be there, proud of yourself that you turned up and you're working and you're facing something that majority of people wouldnt have the will power to face.

      "title": "I made a free neuroscience app to break bad habits like procrastinating to study",
      "body": "Hey guys. like many people here, I’ve had serious issues when it comes to procrastination\n\nSo, last year, I started a journey to break various bad habits (procrastination, sleeping late, smoking, no soda) following a few promising neuroscience protocols. The data from that social experiment highlighted the importance of finding a ‘trigger’ and connecting to the network of like-minded people for accountability.\n\nMy issue was sleeping late. The trigger was my phone and YouTube. To solve this trigger, I moved the power outlet, charger, and phone to the living room and turned it off before going to bed. This decision was “super effective”.\n\nA few of my friends got on board to tackle addictions like smoking and drinking, which were somewhat successful. But the one case I remember strongly was a friend that couldn’t study on time. He just couldn’t sit down and open a book before watching YouTube after work. With his desperation and a call for help, we decided to work together. After some soul searching, we found out that his **trigger** was simple as a browser homepage. Guess what page his browser first showed?\n\n**YouTube** (duh)\n\nAfter a little debate, we changed his home page to one of his online courses and promised to spend just 5 minutes on that page before leaving. So everyday, at 6 pm after work, I checked up on him by Zoom to see if he kept the commitment. In about a week, he was able to study 30 min \\~ 1 hour per day.\n\nApparently, this was his first time studying consistently, everyday.\n\nThis trigger protocol worked great, but it seemed extremely difficult to help hundreds of strangers through personal checkups and/or YouTube videos. That’s why, as some of you already know, I teamed up with a group of scientists and developers to make a useful tool. Our plan was to create a neuroscience-based habit platform where you can find like-minded people and solutions and apply scientific protocols to break bad habits.\n\nWe released an early version and got some feedback. The app had many holes and many features were lacking. But the data was in. With our users’ help, the devs were able to launch an official version a few weeks ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here’s what’s new/upgraded** (\\*but not limited to):\n\n* 3 main neuroscience protocols embedded into the app\n   * [RAS](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/if-you-want-it-you-might-get-it-the-reticular-activating-system-explained-761b6ac14e53)\n   * [Habit loop](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/)\n      * [How rewards stimulates a specific part of the brain in half a second](https://neurosciencenews.com/habits-brain-15805/)\n   * Social win and accountability\n* A fresh tutorial\n* Triggers and real-life solutions\n* Feed system to see others’ triggers and solutions\n* Accountability through matching patterns\n* A bad habit category to choose from\n* More reward for daily and weekly engagements\n* Free brain hacks every week or two via email\n* Improved user experience and interface\n* Faster performance\n* Smarter push notifications\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future plans**\n\n* Tinder for habit (Find your habit match 😘)\n* Group challenges to participate and win\n* 1 on 1 with behavioral scientists & neuroscientists\n* Monetary compensation for helping others\n* More types of data (voice memos, gifs, videos)\n* Blockchain\n* And more...\n\nUnfortunately, an **Android** version isn’t available(yet). But we have one in the pipeline. We want to perfect the IOS version first before launching on Android. So keep in touch with us for **updates** by signing up at our web site: [https://www.braintingle.io/](https://www.braintingle.io/)\n\n**If you'd like to try the official app, go here**: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1477789006](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1477789006)\n\nIf you have any other questions or comments, contact us at [synapse@braintingle.io](mailto:synapse@braintingle.io)\n\nAlso, This is our twitter channel. [https://twitter.com/tinglebrain](https://twitter.com/tinglebrain)\n\nThank you so much for your support and let’s break bad habits together.\n\nTeam **braintingle** (formerly known as, Synapse)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n    \n Edit 1: Woah. I did not expect 100+ comments. Thanks a lot guys  \n    \n Edit 2: Android. Android. Android. We got the msg. It's on the way!\n\n&#x200B;",

      "body": "I know that this forum is usually people asking \" how do I learn about \" a subject, but I thought a bit about how to keep you car running properly might be of interest.\n\nFirst, these points will be general stuff. I am not going to try to diagnose that funny noise in your car. I will cover the subject of \" noises and rattles \".\n\nAll automobiles have common things. Engine, transmission drive train, brakes steering and electrical systems and FLUIDS.\n\nLets talk about fluids. All of the fluids in a car have different colours and in some cases a different texture to the touch.\n\nMotor oil, When new a honey gold, when used a dark brown or black. Brake fluid, light gold colour when new. Radiator coolant, light green or yellow when new. Power steering fluid reddish pink. Transmission fluid, darker red. Windscreen cleaner for summer use, greenish or pink, it has about 5 percent detergent in it to help clean off bug splatter. Winter windscreen washer fluid is a de icer that won't freeze until it gets down to the temperature rated on the label on the jug. If you live in a place where the temps get to below freezing ( minus 10 C or below 30 F ) do not leave summer fluid or worse yet, plain water in your washer tank. It will freeze and crack the plastic tank.\n\nSo now we know about the different colours of fluids. You car is leaking. The colour should help to identify the \"what is it \" now to locate it. Rad is at the front of the engine, tranny is connected TO the engine, and the power steering is powered by a engine belt on the top side of the engine. Put a flattened cardboard box under the engine/tranny area, leave it on the ground after driving the car. Look at it the next day. Don't move it yet. Look at the fluid colour, and where it is dripping from. Start car, wait a few minutes for everything to heat up... look again. If you are going to take it to a repair garage, wipe some of the fluid up with a clean paper towel . The technician can sniff it and usually identify it by the smell and colour.\n\nRecords. All car makers provide a owner's manual with new cars. But over the years they get lost. BUY a owner's manual from the dealership OR download the EXACT manual for your car. Remember this mind helper. YMMET. It means Year Make Model Engine size and type of transmission. \n\nYMMETY is the very first thing that a service writer at the dealership will ask you for. The second information required is the VIN is the  Vehicle Identification Number, It is YOUR car's unique identifier code,. The VIN is found on the left side of the dashboard under the edge of the windscreen., There is also a information plate on the door post next to the side of the driver's seat. It has a lot of info, including the proper air inflation number for your tires and their size. Tires also have their size... year of manufacture and  what weather condition they are rated for. ALL SEASON tires are NOT winter tires. If you live in a snow area  buy winter tires.. Would you wear summer sandals in a foot of snow   ? Of course not.\n\nHaving the makers information book solves many of your \"what is that  thing \" questions. It also sets out exactly what the service schedule is. The service calendar starts when the car is brand new, and goes to at least the 200,000 mile mark. It based on miles driven not months on the calendar.  \n\nMakers recommended service mileage points. IF you follow the book you will extend the lifespan, reliability and resale value of ANY car. Being able to show a perspective buyer the actual repair and service receipts will go a long way towards them wanting to buy it. \n\nEven if your car is 20 year old civic, you still want it to start, drive and STOP with out problems right ? Maintaining a car requires spending money BEFORE it dies 150 miles from home. BUY a AAA membership. ONE tow call ( a hundred miles from home ) will definitely cost more than even the luxury AAA membership does. They also do flat tire changes ( you DO have a spare tire right  ? ) and boost batteries, and bring you enough gas to get to the nearest service station. Its a must, even if your car is all most new.\n\nGas stations. Quite a few cars and light duty trucks use diesel fuel now. Before you start pumping LOOK at the handle of the fuel pump. What colour is it ? YELLOW means diesel fuel. You do not  want to put ANY amount of diesel   in your gasoline powered car. THAT is a huge cost to repair it, and in the case of a older car, its now scrap metal. LOOK before you pump.\n\nGasoline is highly explosive. Its what movie stunt directors use to create those huge fire balls . Gasoline is also very sensitive to static electrical charge. If you are going to fill a portable gas can at the station PUT IT ON THE GROUND. That creates a ground, so the static electrical charge created when the gas flows through the fuel hose to the portable gas can....It will be harmlessly directed into the ground, If you keep the gas can in or on the vehicle ( think back of a pick up truck ) you CAN end up on fire, along with everybody else at the station . \n\nGeneral tools and stuff to keep in your car.\n\nA set of cheap sockets and a ratchet driver, A multi bit screw driver, a pair of vice grips, a small wire cutter, a box cutter, some duct tape and some zip ties in a number of sizes. Hand cleaner, paper towels and a old bath towel to lie on if you need to get on the ground to see something. A big LED flashlight ( at least 12 or more individual bulbs ) with spare batteries for it. OH and a package of fuses. Find out where YOUR cars fuse panel is. \n\nNEVER go under a car that is only supported by a jack. TWO axle stands at minimum. Block opposite end  wheel, to prevent rolling forward or backward. \n\nTires. Buy the BEST that you can get. Tires are NOT the place to try to save money. Try this, Get a piece of chalk, draw a circle around the part of your tire that touches the ground. Now move the car and LOOK at that little chalk circle... that is the only contact point ( times 4 tires ) that you have with the road. If you tires are under inflated you will have poor directional control, even worse in rain or snow. The minimum tread depth that you should  drive on is three thirty seconds of an inch. Minimum. In many jurisdictions 3/32 is illegal and will get your car taken off the road, plus a fine.\n\nDaily walk around. Before you start the engine, check oil and rad coolant. Its a lot easier if things are cool. Drips ? Tires ? \n\nOK get in check mirrors for adjustment. Start and WAIT at least 30 to 60 seconds, for the oil pump to get the cold oil from the bottom of the engine  to the top where the camshaft, crankshaft, valve train, pistons and rods are sitting with only a very thin coating of oil left over from the last time the engine was running The first 5 minutes of each start up of a cold engine, produces about 60 percent of the wear on the engine over it's life span.\n\nOK lost of stuff to absorb , right ?\n\nSo how do I know all this stuff. 50 years of driving, commercial trucks, race cars, Ambulances , limos and a lot of clunkers.\n\nJim B.",

I’ve been in love (like, obsessed) twice before in life and both of those men basically made me beg for love. I guess if I don’t experience some degree of limerence then I think it’s boring. I’m used to being the one asking for more more more. I know that I’m not satisfied with my bf bc he doesn’t force me into that dynamic but there is not a single thing wrong with him and I’m being crazy for not being head over heels. The only thing I can really think of is that I’m used to men being more stoic and he’s… very in touch with his emotions and although I’ve begged my past loves to feel more, it’s a turn off with this guy that he actually does feel more. And I know it’s a me thing, so I want to learn to be fulfilled in a relationship with a man who is everything I’ve ever asked for. There’s just no spark in it for me right now. And it also doesn’t help that I had to see my ex who I had a rollercoaster relationship with the other day and ever since I’ve felt like I’ve been having drug withdrawals. \n\nEDIT: yes I know therapy, attachment, daddy issues, I’m an evil cunt, etc. I was mostly seeking skills from someone who has been in a similar situation.",

I think I've started over ten books and never finished a single one, and when I want to continue with one, I either find it too tedious to keep going or, what's even worse, I feel like I'm interested in another one while reading one and get tempted to read something else.\n\nThis problem also applies to movies and series and games and, well, everything (hence the post title). What's ridicolous is that I actually am interested in all of these things. It's never because of boredom that I cease to read a book, but more out of lazyness/tediousness/loss of interest at the moment I'm reading. What do I do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I start a lot of shit and never finish it because I get interested on other shit too quickly.

What can i practice to become possitive?\n\nEdit: first of all, thank you all for your recomendations. I apreceate you all for taking time off your day to try and help me out. So far I'm practicing meditation, graditude, and certain mindset changes. I will continue to build myself from all kinds of things such as stoism and buhdism and try to learn from everything. Once again thank you all. I wish you all safety, healthiness, and happiness.",

      "body": "Hey redditors!\n\nI'm an information systems student (I learn coding and stuff) with some free time and a passion for music and playing by ear (learning new songs just by listening, without need for music scores)\n\nI've made a ear-training tool (still in development) meant to help those learning how to play by ear to systematically learn how to identify notes, whether a note is higher/lower, a sequences of notes, chords (in development) etc, available at:\n\n[https://pitchgarden.com](https://pitchgarden.com)\n\nI made a reddit post a few days ago regarding the same tool, and received many valuable suggestions and pieces of advice - really appreciate the feedback from y'all very much, and I'm happy to say show y'all some latest updates!\n\nUpdates on pitchgarden:\n\n1. HTTPS has been enabled and the app has been deployed on AWS (rather than on my personal PC) - this should make things much faster! (hopefully)\n2. Mobile formatting has been added (hopefully no more button overflows and all that)\n3. A higher/lower note exercise functionality has been added - 2 notes will play, and you can now practice identifying if the second note is higher or lower!\n4. A sequence note exercise functionality has been added as well - up to 7 notes will be played one after another, and you can now practice identifying all the notes in the sequence! (this gets exponentially harder, especially if you include black keys)\n\nAny feedback/advice is greatly appreciated! Whether the UI is ok/whether stuff is broken/works normally/whether it loads slowly etc. Once again, thank y'all so much for all the suggestions/feedback y'all have given me for this project - really appreciate all of y'all.\n\nCheers!",

Overall a pretty ordinary lifestyle I’d say.\n\nI want to be one of those people that just has an incredibly high sex drive all the time. I’ve had women I’ve dated in the past that always seem to be horny and ready to go whenever. I’ve always been more in the opposite end of that spectrum where I need to be stress free, well-rested, etc to be in the mood and after I finish, my sex drive is pretty much completely gone so no second round, much less third or fourth.\n\nSo how can I become someone that is ready to go pretty much any time and anywhere and for multiple rounds if needed? I’m looking for suggestions that cause long-term libido boost not just a quick fix like popping a pill or taking a shot of tequila haha. I’m willing to put in the work to make necessary lifestyle changes to achieve this goal. I want to be ready so that the next time I date a woman like that I can, not only keep up with her, but have her tapping out. Like I want it to be annoying how horny I am all the time lol",

I was \"started on\" by an older girl when I was 13/14, last night I was stuck awake for over an hour thinking of that scenario and bashing myself for how I should have stood up for myself and she made me look like an idiot. Then repeating the scenario with different endings/outcomes based on what I start thinking I should have done.\n\nI have been doing positive affirmations and also saying how thankful and blessed I am (because my life right now is great and I AM so thankful and blessed) but yet I still seem to catch myself getting stuck in these thought circles.\n\nThank you in advance :)\n\nEdit to add: the example is just an example lol, tbh I had  not thought about that for a long time but as it was last night it was in my head. Sometimes it’s as small as a someone being rude to me whilst out & about, or as big as arguments between my parents during divorce. But I do appreciate all of the responses and ideas.

I'm a master's degree student and researching is literally my life, however I'm really unproductive for the last couple of months. I used to study a lot, mornings at the lab and evenings at the home, always researching and writing papers. Now, I can't even finish reading one goddamn paper! My laboratory performance is still the same, the problem is with reading and writing. My professor keeps giving me new assignments and the work I'm supposed to finish stacks up higher and higher. All the unfinished works make me more stressed out every day and I keep finding myself in front of the computer, playing games to ease my stress. Then, the work stays unfinished and remembering that I wasted my time instead of studying after the gaming session makes me feel more stressed. It's a loop. I'm desperate. Please help me.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for all the help. I can't believe there are so many solutions to my focusing problems! I honestly thought I lost something and couldn't see the way by myself but you guys light a new path in front of me. Thank you sincerely.\n\nI read all the comments and noted them down, so that I could try all of them. And mostly I did. I started with the dopamine detox and said to you that I'll share my experience with it, so here I am. I started my detox yesterday and honestly it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. After closing my phone and pc I got my housework done in an hour (which normally takes a few hours because I keep taking breaks to look at my phone). When my chores were done I was finally alone with myself and then the real challenge began. At first my mind was full of everyday fuss and movies, games etc... I began to watch Rick and Morty in my mind at some point. My mind was never at ease. However after a few hours my mind finally calmed down. Then, I started to apply what I learned from your comments.\n\nFirst, I started with making a to-do-list. All the work that seems impossible to get it done actually started to look doable. I always make lists but I try to schedule every hour in the list, thus can never actually get anything done. This time, I just made a list of things I must finish and placed them on the random days of the week. I found an old agenda and used it, it worked well. Then, I put some rules for myself. I wrote down my weaknesses and strengths, realized that quarantine made everything easy for me and I can't keep up like that with playing games. I decided to stay away from video games and my phone for a while, at least until I'm back to being myself before the quarantine. I'll delete Twitter and Reddit from my phone and only look at them on pc when I'm available. I'll delete my most played games on Steam and only download them back when my work is finished. It seemed impossible before taking a break from them because I love these things. I don't want to leave them but after the detox I think I can handle myself without them. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. \n\nI also tried meditating. It was the hardest part. I couldn't clear my mind for long, but sitting in the dark with myself gave me a different perspective. I will definitely try and do more meditation in the future. Because I realized that as the hours past my thoughts became simpler. Normally I think about lots of things, mostly the things I've seen on Reddit or Twitter. Like, what will happen to Baby Yoda, when's the next episode of The Boys, how can I improve my lying ability for Among Us... But staying with myself, listening myself made me realize that everyday stuff I see on internet has a lot of impacts on my mind. I always thought my mind is too full, feeling uneasy for no reason. But this seclusion actually helped me to realize that I actually haven't lost my focus, it's just on something else. All I need to do is to change my focus for the right stuff.\n\nAlso I remembered why I am doing this work. I love learning. I love researching and trying and making an effort to be helpful to the humanity. I guess after taking a long break in the quarantine I felt like it's a retirement. But it's not. It was break and it's long overdue. All I needed was right people telling me how can I change myself. And you guys did that. I thank you with all my heart.\n\nYeah, I don't think dopamine detox actually affected my dopamine levels because I'm pretty much the same, but it helped me to see things clearly in the absence of stimulants like social media and games. I got a chance to be with myself and enjoy myself. I made new decisions, I realized my mistakes and I hope I can continue my journey from now on. Thank you dear friends! You all helped me through a depressive episode and I really feel better now. I hope you'll all have an amazing day! Much love!",

I've learned in one of my college classes that a true argument is about working together to find a solution to a problem, not about trying to prove someone else wrong or that their proposed idea is better. Learning about politics seems complicated and sometimes difficult to understand. Being vocal about your opinions seems daunting with the wrong crowd, especially one ready to destroy your arguments/viewpoints. Despite all this, I think it's still my responsibility to become educated and well-versed in the basics of politics before I even consider who I want to vote for president or any other elected position.",

Nothing special. But I'm just so lonely and yearn for romantic partnering so bad that it doesn't take much for me to begin to swoon over a girl. Hell, she could just look at me in a friendly way and I'd melt.\n\nWhat makes it worse are the thoughts. It's one thing to become absolutely moved by the nice actions of another towards yourself but then the mind starts trying to draw conclusions. \"Oh, maybe she is into you\" but it's like no! She is just being a decent human being.\n\nOf course that's a vicious circle that always makes me feel depressed. I've been tricked by my own credulity and it gave me a shred of hope if even for a second. But I guess a second is all it takes because even remembering those feelings now as I type this has got me teary eyed. Hope can be a curse once it's taken away. Some angsty feelings but they are there. I used to share a lot of sentiment with this: [angst warning!!](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1267843-i-hate-nice-girls-just-exchanging-greetings-with-them-will) but I've matured since then (I'd like to think).\n\nTo add onto this further I've got one hell of a habit fantasizing. The act of being in a fantasy feels like a sort of drug. It is absolutely intoxicating. It's how I get to sleep most nights. Floating in neverland imagining how life might be should this one desire be fulfilled. I get these sensations in my chest that could only be described as a great potential and desire to burst with romantic affection. To passionately pour it onto someone.\n\nI'm really at a loss.

She said if it’s really bad she’s stopping Chemo cause she wants pain meds they won’t give her any and she’s lost all her hair and all she can do now is chew food and spit it out. She can barely walk and move on her own she talks just fine and is coherent. I have a 6 year old son I’m trying to figure out how to deal with him. He is super close to his grandma I plan to tell his school about the situation, I also need to find people who can help watch him I have all these things I gotta do. I’m the only driver my husband doesn’t drive so his parents will have to get him. I also have my own active Ulcerative Colitis. Is there anything I need to learn or do? Prepare? I feel like I’m in such denial I feel like I’m not taking it serious at all. My mom has beat three types of cancer, She had three serious surgeries she’s always made it you know and I just am in disbelief...I drive to and from her house together is like 50 minutes.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support honestly I feel like Reddit is here for me more than anything else.

I superficially appear to know a lot, use fancy terms, language that makes me sound smart, but truly, deep inside I know nothing.\n\nI can't have a deep conversation about ANY topic, because my understanding of... anything really doesn't go beyond a couple fun facts I heard on a YouTube video, or reading an article on the internet. I know nothing about politics, about science, about communication, about tech. I'm profoundly illiterate and I wish to change that.\n\nHow does one start acquiring knowledge like this? And let me very clear about my intentions, this is all about vanity. I've recently been around very smart people, CRAZY SMART PEOPLE, and they crushed my self-image, I always thought I was at least relatively intelligent, that's not true at all.\n\nHow to be educated?",

I come from an abusive and alcoholic household. Amongst many other things, I’ve never been taught discipline so as an adult I’m finding incredibly difficult to keep up with things consistently. Even little things, like brushing my teeth.... I’ve just crawled out alive from a five year depression, I’ve been feeling good for about a year now and I’ve managed to strip my ego away and actually see what is wrong with me. I’ve set sails towards fixing that but I’m lacking certain tools. I’m 28 F and I study psychology which has given me plenty of insight but at the same time I can’t keep up with my studies as much as I love them. I’m not self destructive anymore and I finally feel alive, I’m awake and I want to enjoy the rest of my life but I can’t if I’m constantly going too easy on myself out of fear that depression will come back. I also overthink like crazy. Can anyone help? Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all your amazing comments. You guys are breathtaking. :)\n\nEdit: I did it!! I set out a schedule which I’m a week into. I stepped back and acknowledged my feelings. I experienced them. It scared me but I got through it. I established a routine on pen and paper and transferred it to a mini blackboard in the kitchen. Such a pleasure ticking completed tasks off. I’m going to try the 21/90 rule. I’ve been sticking to it and also allowing myself some free time and honestly I just can’t describe how much energy I’m feeling. I can’t believe I didn’t do this sooner. So thank you guys. Every comment here, little or big helped me build a solid understanding in how to slay and how to get shit done. <3",

      "body": "There have already been posts in this subreddit about learning how to better express ideas and be more articulate. I've seen the comments, and most of them usually appear to be arbitrary tips (eg. read this specific book, listen to that podcast, watch TED talks, and so on). \n\nHowever, I'm looking for established frameworks that I could apply to have a more systematic/structured way of learning & practicing how to communicate ideas.\n\nWhat I mean by this is, for instance, I’m currently learning how to properly pronounce words and speak clearly. My way of practicing is grounded on “segmental/suprasegmental features of pronunciation” (phonemes, stress, intonation, juncture, etc.) where I would focus on improving 1 feature a day by practicing, listening to other speakers, etc.\n\n\n\nAre there concepts/principles/theories which I could use when learning how to articulate? Here are some of my ideas, which may already have well-established principles out there:\n\n1. Process of articulating (for example, step 1 is to formulate ideas, step 2 is to do this and that, and so on)\n\n2. Patterns of expressing ideas (eg. expressing thoughts in a narrative format; or having an analytical approach of articulating an idea; or explaining an idea by being symbolic, etc.)\n\n3. Dimensions/aspects of articulation (perhaps something like vocabulary, patterns of introducing an idea, order of ideas to present when speaking, etc.)\n\n4. Considerations in articulating based on specific contexts (eg. how to appropriately deliver a message that is bad news for the receiver; or considering the relationship with the receiver in expressing your message, like your boss vs your friend; speaking in an informal setting vs delivering a speech)\n\n5. Well-established rules on how to structure the words of a sentence / sentences of a paragraph in order to portray a specific feeling/meaning (eg. if you mention X before Y, the receiver would think/feel A; if you mention Y before X, the receiver would think/feel B; if you omit X and only express Y, the receiver would think/feel C)\n\n6. Rules of communication in general (whether it be something technical, or even something like eg. rules in building relationships through dialogue)\n\n\n\n\nDo you know any well-established concepts (or maybe even articles) that may answer any of these things I have mentioned, or in some way could help explain the art of articulating ideas/feelings?\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!",

      "body": "I don't mean a tiny home as in the trend these days, but a home with fixtures and amenities that are scaled down to my height--which is 3ft tall.\n\nI am just now looking into buying a home in the next year.  I have extreme dwarfism and use a power wheelchair, but currently live independently in an apartment.  I've been gaining weight and losing all of the strength I had as a kid when I pushed a manual wheelchair and used a walker outside of my chair a lot more.  I've recently bought some kids furniture and am going to be reorganizing my bedroom to be low down on the ground.  I've considered putting stage decking in my apartment so I can be higher up and closer to the windows, but I'm still going to have to get into my wheelchair to use the toilet or shower, or the stove/fridge.\n\nOne day, I'd like to be able to build a small kids playhouse looking thing that has railing for me to walk with, a small shower and toddler's toilet, small rooms and windows, something entirely inaccessible for abled folks.  A garage to park my wheelchair and transfer groceries or whatever into the kitchen, etc.\n\nThis is a lifelong pipe dream, but now that I am going to be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home that I likely wont be able to use most of anyway, I'm really wondering what it'd take to get the little home of my dreams.  I know I can and will be modifying a regular home to where I wouldn't need to get into my chair, with step-stools and the like--but balancing on the edge of stools is what I do all day, I hate it.  Plus ceilings being so high up and dropping things making them so far away, I'd just like to be more grounded and present in my space.\n\nMy question is less to do with the actual crafting of these things, but with the laws and types of craftspeople I'd need to get something like that done.  I want something hooked up to water and sewer, and I know that it'd break every building ordinance there is in most cities.  I figured maybe someplace like Seattle would have room for something like that if it was labeled an art installation?  I also figure if the side of the house could be opened like a door that'd make it less of a hazard for rescue workers to fish me out of it.\n\nTL;DR: Where in the US would I have to move to put a detached dwarf-sized home with all the bells and whistles of a big house and be a-okay with city ordinances, and what kind of professionals would I need to hire to do something like that?  It's always just been a dream, and I'd at least like to have a roadmap as to how I'd even make it possible--so I can at least stop thinking about it as I buy a home that wont have those things.\n\nIf this isn't the right forum for this, I apologize--I'm sure contractors or whatnot could answer this question better.  Really cool subreddit honestly, I will be sticking around.",

I'm hyper aware of how I'm speaking when in conversation, which also adds to the awkwardness of my speech. I also have a really bad habit of nervously laughing at EVERYTHING. I've had multiple people even ask me why I'm laughing. It's become an awful habit. I'm wondering if anybody has had these kinds of issues and any resources they can recommend.

I can get into a bad mood like this too when I am overhelmed at work. Its written all over my face because sometimes people will ask me what's wrong or if I'm okay.

      "body": "Perhaps this is a weird question, but I always enjoyed reading in my free time during high school/college. I used to read mostly fiction. After college, I didn’t read much at all. Thanks to quarantine, I’ve picked up a few new books and have dived back into it (I wish I never stopped)! This time around, I’ve been getting more and more into non-fiction. I really want to continue educating myself in new subjects and improve on becoming a knowledgeable and well-rounded person. \n\nBut I’ve noticed that I can hardly recall some of the things I’ve read in non-fiction. The focus and interest is there—but I can’t seem to explain to anyone in detail what exactly I’m reading or what I’ve learned without the book in my hand. I *feel* like I’m learning new things while I read, but months later I feel like I’ve lost that knowledge. Is this normal?\n\nMy dad, for example, was well-read for most of his adult life and even though he hasn’t picked a book up in a few years now, he can still recall *so much* information from previous books he’s read. He doesn’t really have an explanation for it. Maybe my memory is just terrible, lol.\n\nSometimes I wonder if school set me up this way. For example, from the time we started reading and all throughout high school, we’d have to read so many books a semester and take tests on each one. The grades from the tests would be figured into our English class’s final grade (20% if I recall correctly. Of course you can easily memorize facts and key points from a book and take a test shortly after finishing (like most subjects), but does that information truly stick with you if you’re just recalling short term knowledge because you *have* to? I want to be able to learn things that stick with me and better me as a person for the long-term, if that makes sense. \n\nAny tips or advice? Am I thinking too much into this?",

So my income isn't gonna be the most stable as compared to someone with a full time job.

(I'm not trying to commit tax fraud :P) For reference, I'm Australian, so if anyone understands these things from an Aussie perspective any tips tricks or pointers as to where to start would be amazing, but even if anyone has any tips in general it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnd as a general inquiry, I've been looking into microinvestments, especially convenient apps like Raiz and spaceship voyager. Would they be a good place to start? Or are they risky and/or not worth it for the small amounts I would be investing.\n\nThank you in advance to everyone who responds, I hope everyone is having an awesome day :)\n\nEdit: I was not expecting this many responses and they are for the most part extremely welcome and helpful! I'll be taking what I can on board. I've responded to a few and read all of your comments so thank you all for taking the time to impart your wisdom. As of now, I've set myself a little bit of a timeframe, and I'm hoping to spend the next few months learning as I go, and by July when the next financial year begins hopefully I'll be confident enough to start acting on that knowledge.

It is my job, and passion, to help care for others. If you are on a ventilator, or say in so much pain you can’t speak, or your visiting relatives are the only ones in the emergency bay that can communicate the last thing you ate, or previous health conditions, or symptoms you’ve told them about for the last few days before you suddenly hit the floor, you BET it helps to be able to communicate past language barriers without calling HR to request an interpreter, or carry around a language line.\n\nI strive to care for people.

The first decade was the NY/NJ PATH train which took about a half hour, and the second decade was NJ Transit which took a minimum of one hour but more commonly was an hour and a half to two hours.\n\nI became adept at sleeping on the train, especially on NJ Transit and *especially* in the morning on the way into work. I’d sit down, close my eyes, and before I knew it I was in Manhattan. The noise of the train didn’t bother me, and that’s part of the issue.\n\nThe problem now is that any time I’m sitting in an area with a constant droning of noise, I immediately get tired. Doesn’t matter where I am, how much sleep I’ve had, or anything like that. I just want to take a nap. It could be a car ride, sitting on a bench at a shopping mall, at a carnival, whatever. If there’s a constant level of noise I go right out. It’s not uncommon for me to have a five hour energy shot if I’m driving more than about 45 minutes.\n\n I believe sleeping on the train for so many years has conditioned me to be this way.

You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.\n\nI’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.\n\nEven after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.\n\nI’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank.\n\nPeople think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.\n\nI’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.\n\nIt’s been 5 months",

Today he got way too drunk (he was a recovering alcoholic) and got in to a big argument with my mom. They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can’t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can’t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don’t know what to do. That’s all I can really say...\n\nIf you need help, please get it. Because of a horrible combination of alcohol, guns and depression, my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and I am now with out a dad.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for all the sentiments. I know it’s strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone, I guess. I 100% agree about therapy and I am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives. Sadly, money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy, I would be very grateful.",

Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I’d get something, sometimes I’d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights.

      "body": "My husband has been struggling for a long time with both physical and mental issues.\n\nOn the 25th, he had another rage episode and broke another phone. I normally let him storm off and he watches TV for the whole night. This time I heard him sobbing in the living room.\n\n  \nI find him with his blade out (he bought this months ago, just to have the perfect thing to kill himself with). Not just holding it sheathed, but blade out. I thought the best thing to do would just to be near him, so I sit on the couch and reach for my phone.  \n\"Don't even bother.\"  \n\"Bother with what?\"  \n\"Getting me another phone. I won't need it. I am going to end it.\"\n\nI tried talking with him, but he just kept spiraling. I made a call now I wish I had not. I called 911, but did not speak. I just let them hear what he was saying.\n\nHe told me if I ever called when he got like this, he would end it before anyone could make it here. Or he would leave without his phone so he could not be tracked and kill himself where he would be found.\n\nI should have listened.\n\nThe police came. At least ten of them. They pulled me out of the house and most of them went in to try and talk him down. It took them nearly an hour to get him to give up the blade.\n\nThey allowed me to step in and get my phone. I tried calling both his psychiatrist and psychologist. Never had an afterhours number. I called the center his psychiatrist was affiliated with, but they refused to take my husband due to him using a CPAP.  \n  \nThe police told me that they could not leave him as is, especially since he punched something and damaged his hand. They called in some other people to talk to him to get him to agree to meeting with one of their doctors who would be in at 8am. He consented. The police said they would take him to the hospital to get his hand checked and then to the outpatient doctor.\n\nAt the ER a social worker became involved. They deemed him a danger to himself and others and they began to look for an inpatient facility to take him to. Something that he said he would never go back to. I was asked to bring his CPAP to the hospital and they would let me know when they found a facility.\n\nHours later, my husband calls me. His first words were \"What.... the.... f\\*ck!\" I was in shock as I had not gotten a call from the hospital yet saying that they were transferring him. I asked where he was, and he said he did not even know. He said that he never signed up for his. He only agreed to talk to someone, not get locked up. He said this would never happen again and left the phone without hanging it up.\n\nI called the number back to and was asked for his patient access code. He never gave it to me. Thankfully someone was able to get it for me and transferred me to his ward. The person said \"Oh, he is eating his lunch right now and cannot talk\" and told me he had not seen a doctor yet.\n\nHours later they call me and tell me that he was demanding to be released. When they said that they could not do that he said he wanted to speak to a doctor. They said the doctors were gone for the day and he could talk to one the next day. He then punched out two windows of some kind (sounds like the barrier windows between patients and reception workers). Then he returned to his room. They when to check on him and he had started tearing apart the AC unit (maybe to find something sharp to kill himself or to tear out wires to electrocute himself).\n\nI made him hate me and his is trying to die. It's all my fault.",

      "body": "As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. \nIdk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",

      "body": "I am usually the most positive, motivated, & outgoing person ever, but with COVID-19 affecting every aspect of my life, it wasn’t a surprise I became deeply depressed. I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can’t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me. And for an update on my mental, I am doing incredibly better. Don’t want to go too in depth because he deserves all the love on this post. Thank you for reading. ♥️",

Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

      "body": "When I was 17 I decided to take acid with my friends and I ended up going through a traumatic bad trip that some may call \"ego death\", my subjective self was basically fading away and I felt like I was dying and literally entering vegetative state as I just couldn't remember how to speak who I was nor what my purpose was.\n\nWhen the trip was over I was fine but still in shock.\nThen after a few weeks I started having ptsd and anxiety attacks that made my life hell. Now fast forward a few years and I just feel depersonalized all the time, like I'm not there. Of course I can ground myself, but sometimes I just get disconnected from reality, go through derealizations and feel like I'm just a little man watching my life through the lense of my eyes.\n\nHave anyone gone through similar things ? Please help me\n\nAlso if you're contemplating doing psychedelics and you're below 25, please don't, what people say is true, don't gamble losing yourself for 3 hours of pleasure",

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.\n\nMaybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.\n\nBut this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work. I put the fear that all this shit in my life was because Im just lazy behind me. I enjoy working. Im crying.",

For the past 10 years it's just been hospitalization after hospitalization. 13 hospital visits and 7 attempts later I thought there was no hope for me. But I did it. I love my job. I love my friends. I love my son. I love my life. And I'm going to keep fighting as hard as I can to maintain this. Not just for my son but for me, because I deserve to be happy. I deserve to feel safe.

      "body": "My son is 14 (I’m dad). Yesterday he asks me if I ever feel sad. I told him sometimes. He asks me what I do when I feel sad. I said talk to mom, spend time with family, do something I enjoy. Sometimes only time helps. \n\nI ask him if he is feeling sad. He says “yeah I guess.” I ask him why. He starts to cry a little at this point. He says “I don’t really know. My life is perfect and stuff. I just don’t really enjoy it. I wish I could.”\n\nI ask about school, he says he’s not being bullied or anything. He says nothing bad has happened to him. He says “I just wish I could be happy and excited about things sometimes you know?” \n\nI tell him I’m sorry he feels this way. I say “you know I love you and care about you right?” He says “yeah. I wish it helped.” We hug for a long time. I encourage him to describe how it feels more.\n\nHe says “life’s just hard. Everything just takes so much effort. And I’m like tired but not sleepy a lot. I don’t know if that makes sense. Sometimes I wish I could be a kid again. Life was so much easier then.”\n\nI suggest maybe we find someone he can talk to about this. He says “like a therapist?” I say yeah. He says “it’s like not that bad though. I’ll be fine. It’s not that big a deal.” I say we don’t have to wait until it gets really bad. He’s still hesitant. I suggest he just give it a try and if he doesn’t like it he can quit. He agrees. \n\nLater that night I check on him once he’s gotten in bed. We talk for a bit. Then he asks “could you just stay with me for a little while?” So I lay down beside him on his bed and we talk some more. \n\nI suggest maybe I pick him up after school tomorrow and we go get ice cream and we can just drive around town and stuff and stop somewhere if he wants. He rolls his eyes and says “ice cream can’t solve all my problems.” I say “so you are passing up ice cream and a chance to do whatever you want on a school night? He says “I guess not. That’s fine.”\n\nHe kinda hugs me and I just stay there until he falls asleep and then I leave. It just breaks my heart seeing him so down like this. \n\nIs there anything else I can do for him? Looks like there are wait lists for a lot of therapists. I’m with him a lot more than a therapist would be. How can I support him?",

I’m 18 and not really interested in politics so I have very little opinions regarding his political views, simply because I’m not informed at all. But I’ve seen my fair share of Charlie Kirk debate videos on social media so when I saw the first half and didn’t read the caption I just thought I was one of those but then I saw everything happen from close up. I’m leaving to college in ten days and now I have this horrible feeling that anything can happen to me or my family. I found myself stuck to my Moms hip the past few hours like a little kid because I can’t stand to be alone. It was incredibly graphic and now I don’t even wanna play the video games I was playing because they guns in them. Now I have these dark thoughts that this world is filled with so much darkness and evil that I can’t stand to wanna go see it for myself out in the real world. I feel deeply scarred by that video and just want to think about anything else. Is anybody else feeling the darkness surrounding this horrible event? And also how does this stuff get past Instagram guidelines, and why would anyone wanna subject others to the viewing?",

You may think i’m making this up but i’m not i swear.\nTonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn’t for my cat i’d be dead. I can’t thank him enough, he’s my angel baby. I love him so much.\n\nUpdate: I’m better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I’m not okay, but I’m working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support! Ive been getting more love from strangers than I get from friends and family. It means the world to me.❤️\n\nEdit: I will not be showing pictures of my cat. Not in a mean way, but in a way for my privacy. I came on here to be “anonymous” in ways, just so if someone i personally know comes across this they can’t tell it’s me. Thank you for all the support, it means a lot. I just wanted to share what saved my life last night.\n\nAnother Update: Hi! so I wanted to come back on here and give y’all a new update. First off, thank you ALL for so much support and love! It means the world to me, for a few weeks I kept coming back to this post. Basically, I’m doing amazing. I have new school opportunities, a new relationship, new friends. My life has truly turned around. I got out of my toxic relationship, healed, found to love myself again, and now I’m loved by the most amazing guy. Thank you all, you helped me all through a very hard time! If anyone feels the way I felt in this post, please, feel free to reach out to me, call help, trust me on this. I’ve had to do it, it’s not scary trust me. But my messages are totally free for anyone who needs anything! Much love!",

      "body": "I’m 38. I’ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I’m doing well—career, family, stability. But inside, I’ve spent years quietly falling apart.\n\nMy first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn’t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.\n\nOne night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it—I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.\n\nEventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn’t brave—I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.\n\nAt 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn’t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.\n\nI didn’t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day—and I’ve never forgotten it.\n\nA doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I’d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.\n\nSince then, I’ve stayed sober. I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pokémon cards. I told myself it was “investing,” but really, I was spinning out.\n\nWhen I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don’t know what I am—other than confused.\n\nNow, even with meds and sobriety, I’ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It’s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don’t fully understand what’s happening inside me.\n\nI’m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still—some days I feel like I’m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.\n\nI guess I’m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don’t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:\n\nI’m still here. Still trying.",

      "body": "I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. \n\nBut I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. \n\nI’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. \n\nBut it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. \n\nI know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.\n\nMissing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. \n\n\nTL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things. Nothing worthwhile comes easily.",

      "body": "I’m a former registered nurse. I used to advocate for patients in distress. I believed in the healthcare system. I believed in doing the right thing.\n\nBut when I had my own psychiatric emergency, I learned the hard way that those same systems don’t always show up for people like me—especially if your disability is invisible.\n\nIn 2024, after my provider tapered me off my psychiatric meds, I became severely overstimulated at work. I tried to do the responsible thing. I drove myself to a behavioral health ER in New Lenox, IL. I wasn’t violent. I wasn’t a threat. I was in distress. I needed help.\n\nThey admitted me—but later issued a warrant for my arrest based on behavior that happened during that mental health episode. I didn’t even know until I was arrested five months later—in another state—while still in active psychosis. I sat in jail for 30 days awaiting extradition. No care. No understanding. Just punishment.\n\nAnd it didn’t stop there.\n\nDespite being hospitalized and submitting a signed accommodation request from my doctor, I was forced out of my apartment. Management outright denied my disability. This, despite me receiving SSDI, having a well-documented condition, and being taken away by ambulance during a clear psychiatric emergency. They claimed my symptoms weren’t related to mental illness at all—they labeled it criminal behavior. I guess if you speak clearly and look “put together,” you’re not mentally ill. You’re just a problem to be removed.\n\nNow I’m stuck in limbo with the SSA. I applied for expedited reinstatement of my disability benefits nearly a year ago—after my trial work period failed and I had multiple hospitalizations. SSA policy says it should take 30 days. I’ve received nothing but duplicate letters falsely stating I’m employed and endless contradictions from representatives. I have to request critical payments monthly just to survive.\n\nI went from nurse… to criminalized… to forgotten.\n\nAll for doing what I was taught to do: ask for help.\n\nI’m posting this because I know I’m not alone. There are others out there with psychiatric disabilities who’ve been judged, punished, or ignored because we don’t “look” disabled. Because we’re too “put together” or “coherent” to be believed.\n\nIf this has happened to you, I see you. And I hope someday these systems will see us too.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Not that I don't (I do), but I feel so far from achieving them or that I'll never achieve them. I'm graduating college in December and I'm absolutely terrified of being out of school. I look around at my peers and they seem so much more... professionally mature than me? It's a weird feeling and its hard to explain. Everyone around me seems to always be doing *something* to benefit them and then there's me. I procrastinate; I have major anxiety; I want to just sleep every day and I am so down in the dumps. I don't know what to do and I'd love to meet people who feel the same way as me. Ive been struggling with this feeling since I started college and I don't know what to do.\n\nEDIT: wow, thank you all for your kind words!! Im sorry i cant get around to replying to all of them.

      "body": "So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._\n\nTLDR; Adopted a cat during quarantine, and our bond continues to grow rapidly day by day. Very rewarding experience and eases the pains of quarantine.",

There is a light. \n\n3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. \n\nWithin that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. \n\nFor two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. \n\nNow, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. \n\nTherapy saved me. But not my therapist. \n\nMy therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. \n\nThat’s not how it worked for me. \n\nA lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. \n\nThey think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. \n\nI did. \n\n(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.\n\nTherapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.\n\nI can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. \n\nI hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. \n\nP.S. I’m new to Reddit. And I like it a lot. I’ve already made friends. If you need a friend, I’m here!",

And now we all know he changed because he was dying of colon cancer. I say all of this as a reminder to please not comment on people’s bodies, especially changes in their weight. You never know what’s going on in someone’s life, and barring that, it’s none of your damn business.”",

I would like to say that I am not from the USA I’m from Belgium still thanks for your advice because a lot of it still applies here and they might have helped someone from the USA. I also would like to say that I don’t hate my school councillor but that her advice was just bad and that I just wish that a mental health professional talked to me earlier.\n\nHere is some [mental health help](https://awel.be) for if you live in Belgium (Flanders I don’t how it is for Wallonia) it’s mainly focused on teens and kids.

We went back to her office & she didn't want to speak to us & instead sent her secretary to talk to us. He told us to follow him outside, took us to the parking lot, yelled at us, squared up & called us sick. He said that since we are \"sick\" we should be careful. I told him that the doctor couldn't say those things to me & he said \"Who's the doctor? She is, so she can say it & you said it first.\" Then he cussed at us & told us to leave.

      "body": "Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.\n\nAfter, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.\n\nBut now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.\n\nBut I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.\n\nOne thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.\n\nEveryone is different and take as much time you need to heal.\n\nFor me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.\n\nI am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.\n\nI am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now.",

Plus, they have a bad habit of labelling EVERYTHING as a \"trauma response\". You're a picky eater? Trauma. You get nervous around crowds? Trauma. Theyll even say that PRETENDING to have trauma is a sign of trauma. It seriously pisses me off, because what they're doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health.

But outside of medication/therapy, I’ve also significantly improved my levels of anxiety over the past few years with some very simple habits that I’ve incorporated into my life.\n\nThe single best thing I ever did for my anxiety was to reduce my screen time. I used to be constantly scrolling on social media all day. The overstimulation gave me this constant background hum of anxiety. Wasting time gave me anxiety. Comparing myself to others gave me anxiety. The depressing content gave me anxiety. It was just all around so toxic.\n\nSo I finally told myself that I desperately needed to reduce my screen time. I tried a lot of things - leaving my phone in another room, setting time limits, turning the screen to black and white, but nothing really stuck. Eventually I found an app, which gamifies reducing screen time in a way that you can compete with friends. I tried it with my girlfriend and it immediately helped - it made us accountable to each other and actually made it fun to stay off our phones.\n\nMy question for you: if you could only pick one habit that helps anxiety, what would it be?",

      "body": "13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.\n\nOf course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.\n\nBut Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.\n\nAnd worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”\n\nThis one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”\n\nYet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”\n\nI hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.\n\nEDIT\n\nThank you for all of the heartfelt responses and experiences you have shared. I truly had started to believe I was in the minority with my critique of 13 Reasons Why. I’m glad to know there are others who share the same concerns.",

      "body": "When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add I know it is my mom's right to have sex. I know it's natural, but I just don't like hearing it\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all for the kind words. You are all so sweet and helpful.",

Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he’d start meowing. Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.\n\nWhen I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.\n\nSince the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.\n\nLiterally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat. But lot of his effort goes in vain, and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try.",

Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. \n\nThis guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go.

If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily.

      "body": "On Friday I ended up having a mental breakdown and sent him a long (and embarrassing) message telling him how hurt I was. He bumped up our appointment so we could talk. So we’ve had two sessions since then, one Monday and one today. They both went well.\n\nAs for the first incident when I heard him say “she’s so..”. I did ask him what he said. He said that he mentioned me having sensory difficulties due to being autistic, and was asking a coworker if a smell in the office was too overwhelming/if he needed to move spaces to not bother me. So I’m assuming he said “she’s sensitive” and not “she’s so” whatever. He told me he wasn’t even able to think of anything he would shit talk about and wouldn’t talk about me that way. So that was just a misunderstanding.\n\nAs for the second incident where he said he didn’t want to see me, he did admit to saying that and apologized. He said that he was personally triggered by our rupture and that it was entirely to do with how he was feeling and had nothing to do with him actually not wanting to see me. He accepted full responsibility for hurting me and said that it was his fault and I didn’t do anything wrong.\n\nThe past two sessions were good. We talked over everything. He was extremely apologetic and I’ve decided to forgive him, so I’ll still continue to see him for the time being. I’m still feeling a little insecure but we’ve come up with strategies to help me feel more secure in the therapeutic relationship. He says if we can repair the ruptures we’ve had then the relationship will be stronger and more healing.\n\n\nSo a bit of an anticlimactic update, but everything went okay and we’re going to try and make it work. Thank you guys for all the support when I was in a low place 💛",

      "body": "My therapist was 83 years old, and I (50 F) knew he wouldn’t be here forever, but we had weekly telephone appointments, and he always sounded quite well. When he missed the first one, I assumed he was away, and either he forgot to tell me, or I forgot he told me. I was 99% sure it wasn’t that I forgot though, because I always said “next week, same time same place?” and he would always laugh and say yes. When he didn’t phone me for the second one, I was concerned, but I knew he had close family and if something happened, they were there for him. I did try his number and got his normal voicemail, but I didn’t leave a message. I assumed something had happened, and I was keeping an eye on the obituaries. I was bummed out thinking about him being seriously ill or dying, but I felt okay-ish. Then last night I was sitting on the deck watching the birds over the marsh, and an Osprey came out of the treetops on the other side and flew three or four slow, beautiful circles over the water and disappeared back into the forest. It made me think of him, because he would always chuckle at the way I get excited about birds, and Ospreys are not common where I live. I looked again for an obituary, and my stomach dropped when I found one. I wasn’t prepared for it. When I read it, I had such a mixture of feelings. I didn’t know much about him at all, but he lived an incredible life, and the obituary mentioned what a loving, kind and sensitive person he was, which I never thought about, but in retrospect is accurate. I felt so grateful to him, for his gentleness and kindness with me over the years. I’ve grown and changed so much through working with him, and I felt very lucky to have found a therapist that was a good fit for me. Then grief hit me, realizing that I’ll never get his perspective again, never wonder if I’m off-base, or being wretched, or unfair, and ask him what he thinks. The obituary also kind of stirred up some abandonment issues, I think, because it mentioned that he had been given a terminal diagnosis over a year ago, and (ridiculously) I think a part of me is trying to process that he didn’t say goodbye. Common sense tells me that dying is something that happens without our permission or input, but I’m just… struggling.\n\nEdited to add that it’s been 8 days since I posted this, and it was the best thing I could have done. I really needed and appreciated the support and suggestions everyone offered here, and while I couldn’t bring myself to write anything more for a while, I am so grateful for everyone here.",

      "body": "Ok so I made a post last week talking about how I have a crush on my therapist (or the fancy word “transference”) and last week I decided to try to pursue him and came to our session wearing provocative clothing and extra make up. Nothing unprofessional happened at the session, but I felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed afterwards and almost cancelled our next session and almost told him we couldn’t afford him anymore so I wouldn’t have to see him again. However, thank you to the absolutely wonderful people on this sub who were so encouraging and kind and supportive who convinced me not to.\n\nThis morning I went to my session wearing jeans and a zip up hoodie with the hood pulled up and was just staring at the floor. He noticed I seemed less confident and energetic than usual, and asked if anything was wrong and I told him I was embarrassed about something I was scared to talk about. Then after some long and awkward pauses was finally able to tell him why I was wearing what I was and what my intentions were (basically “I find you very very handsome and was hoping I’d get your attention and we could spend our session having sex”). I had to imply some things because I was just so mortified but he was very nonjudgmental about it.\n\nHe said he did notice I was acting a little out of character but he was proud of me that I was able to tell him that, and he admired me for doing so since it probably took a lot of courage. He then told me transference is very normal so he was not at all offended or felt disrespected by my behavior. In fact he told me he appreciated the compliment of me saying i thought he was handsome. I felt a lot better after that and we were able to move on and I talked to him about some stuff going on at work just fine.\n\nSo yeah. It all worked out. He didn’t call me names like I was (irrationally) scared of and we were able to move on. One big thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and helped me find the courage to talk to him. I appreciate you all so so much and this sub is very special.",

If any of you are their clients, you're lucky (and also, that's really weird to think about...) But I've been living with them for a little over a month now, and I have become the self-appointed client advocate in their lives. They *need* one.\n\n**Content Warning:** For all of you who have not come to terms with the fact that your therapists are real people in the real world, this post isn't for you.\n\nThe following are real conversations I have had with these fully-licensed, experienced therapist-people I'm related to. You're welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why You Can't Judge a Therapist by Their Facial Expressions**\n\nDad: Seeya tonight, hon!\n\nMe: Dad, your teeth.\n\n*(My dad has a partial with two fake front teeth because of an accident involving a kayak and our garage and a dog leash. Don't ask.)*\n\nDad: Oh yeah! Thanks!\n\nMe: You need to keep a set in your office, Dad. You CANNOT forget those.\n\nDad: Sometimes I forget.\n\nMe: And what do you do?!\n\nDad: I just don't smile for the whole session.\n\nMe: DAD. You cannot do that to people. You're going to give your clients a complex. If Mister T didn't smile at me for a whole session I'd contemplate why he suddenly hated my guts for, like, 36 hours at least.\n\nDad: Well, most of my clients don't treat therapy like an improv comedy show like you and Mister T.\n\nMe: STILL.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMe: Um... mom? Did something... happen... to your face?\n\nMom: Oh yeah! I got stung by a bee! Is it noticeable?\n\nMe: Uh... yeeeees.\n\nMom: Well, it's telehealth, so I doubt it will bother anyone.\n\nMe: You kinda look like you're winking, though. Us clients, we read into that stuff, mom.\n\nMom: Not everyone is like you, Selfless.\n\nMe: MOM. I'm an anxious person! People hire you because they are also anxious people! Your clients *are* like me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Switching Back to In-Person is Weird for Them, Too**\n\nDad: First day back with clients in the office!\n\nMom: Remember, don't hug any women.\n\nDad: I have not done that for like... 15 years!\n\nMe: Dad... when people come in-person, they can see your pants.\n\nDad: I know...\n\nMe: Can... *you...* see your pants right now?\n\nMom: You painted in those yesterday! You can't wear those!\n\nDad: Shit! I'm already late!\n\nMe: Change your pants, dad.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**They Don't Always Tell You Everything (But You Knew That)**\n\n*(Noticed that my mom pauses and sighs every time she reaches the bottom of our staircase.)*\n\nMe: Rough journey from the second floor again?\n\nMom: No... I'm just thinking about one of my clients. She's so depressed, and the stairs from her apartment seem so endless and daunting so she doesn't leave much. Every time I go down our stairs, I think about her, and I think, \"I did it. You can do it, too. I know it.\"\n\nMe: That's really sweet, mom. You should tell her.\n\nMom: *(Takes out her phone, and emails her client.)* Good idea. I just did.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*(My dad makes homemade wooden toys. He's really into slingshots lately.)*\n\nDad: Look, Selfless! This one is for my co-worker, and this one is for \\[your son\\], and... man. I wish I could give this one to a client of mine. He'd love it.\n\nMe: Well, you know it's probably not a good idea to hand out weaponry to your clients. But you should tell him you thought about how he'd like it.\n\nDad: Do you think I could send it to him anonymously?\n\nMe: I *hope* you're kidding.\n\nDad: I... am...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add:\n\nHe just got home.\n\nMe: Dad, how was in-person?\n\nDad: *(Stops dead in his tracks, swivels around to face me)* It. Was. So. Weird.\n\nMe: Right?! SO WEIRD.\n\nDad: THE WEIRDEST.\n\nMe: I KNOW.\n\nDad: We were just... THERE.\n\nMe: Like, ALL THE WAY.\n\nDad: I KNOW.\n\nMe: It gets better after a few sessions.\n\nDad: Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo. Hello from the other side. My parents are wacky. Therapists are human. Sometimes, it's actually helpful to see behind the curtain. So here's my patient perspective on a therapist's perspective on psychotherapy!

I was talking about patterns. Childhood stuff. Attachment. Shame. Boundaries. Identity. Who I actually am when I’m not in crisis.\n\nTurns out healing feels a lot like hurting… but with better posture.\n\nI’m still in therapy every week. The conversations are way more honest now.

Every time she would ask if there was anything that I wanted to talk about, I could never seem to muster up the courage to bring it up, and would just continue to suffer in silence.\n\n This past week I could feel my emotions coming to a head, and I was close to having a breakdown. However, I held it together and made it to my session. About 5 minutes in, my T asked if there was anything on my mind. I completely broke down and everything came spilling out; the suicidal thoughts, the severe anxiety, and how I had reached my limit. I was crying hysterically and could not not catch my breath or control myself. My T stared at me in silence for about a minute and then asked if she could sit next to me. She sat right by me, took both of my hands, and I realized she had tears in her eyes. She began to cry, and apologized for not realizing the severity of my depression and expressed sympathy for my pain. We were able to discuss a plan that would involve my doctor and psychiatrist getting involved. She assured me that she would be there to help me work through this, and I promised to be more honest with her. \n\nI have never had a session that felt more healing than this one. Experiencing such raw emotion (on both sides) and seeing that my T genuinely cares about me is a huge step in our work. I hope that this will be one of many steps. \n\nTLDR: Finally told my T about severe depression and suicidal thoughts. She cried with me, and it was a huge step in my healing",

I overheard him say, “okay it’s the last client of the day, she’s so….” And he lowered his voice to where I couldn’t hear him and had a negative tone. \n\nI don’t know if I’m overreacting but I’m so upset. I couldn’t make myself bring it up to him during our appointment so I just acted normal. Now I’m just stuck filling in the blanks of what he could’ve possibly said. \n\nIt isn’t the first time I’ve overheard him talking about me either. The last time this happened was a couple months ago after a rupture. He was talking to a Coworker and said “I really don’t want to see this next client” and went “Ughhhh” right before he opened the door to come grab me.\n\nI know in reality I should just find a new therapist that doesn’t hate me so much, but he’s so close to my house and is the only therapist near me that takes my insurance. I’m just so hurt. He says all these nice things about me during my appointments and it just feels like he’s lying to my face.\n\n\nEdit: Well I think I’m just going to send him this post and cancel my next appointment. I’ll still see him next week since I’m twice weekly and we’ll talk about it then I guess.",

      "body": "We talk a lot about \"attachment\" and \"transference\" in here. Because we're smart and we know fancy therapy words. \n\nBut let me dish out some simple, not-fancy truth a sec: \n\n**There is nothing stupid, or foolish, or wrong about bonding with other humans, in any setting. It's what we do.** \n\nYour therapist might be kind, or a good listener, or funny, or smart, or legit attractive, or *any of the things people are.* If they went to a shit-ton of school because they really wanted to help people sort out their messed-up lives, they're probably going to be at least a few of those things. And liking someone who gives you positive attention? Yeah, that's just human nature. There is nothing. NOTHING. To feel bad about there. \n\nI get that we pay them to be in the room. Like, I know. I do it, too. We give them money because they're specially trained to be in the room really well for us. **But they're still people. And we're still people.** And when you spend a lot of time with someone, relationships happen, yo. \n\n\"But I wish my therapist was my mom and that's weird.\" Is it weird to wish you had a mom that showed up and listened to you and supported you? Nope. That sounds real normal. \n\n\"But I want to have sex with my therapist, and that's weird.\" Is it, though? It just sounds like you happen to be attracted to people, and your therapist is one of them. Hell, have you ever thought a cashier or a waiter or the landscaper at your place of employment was hot? Yeah, me too. \n\n\"But when my therapist goes on vacation I think about them and I'm sad and that's...\" Don't even say it. \n\n**Therapy relationships are relationships. Therapists are people. We're going to** ***feel*** **things, friends. And I think we could be a little kinder to ourselves about how legit and totally ok those feelings are.** \n\nWe know our therapists feel stuff, too. Whether they tell you about it or not. In our last session we were debriefing:\n\nMister T: I'm sorry I made that decision for you. I was trying to protect you, but you're not mine to protect. \n\nMe: Thanks for saying that. That was... pretty vulnerable of you.\n\nMister T: Just bein' a human. \n\nSee? Humans, all the way down.",

      "body": "Sharing this because I keep seeing threads where naming transference gets you dropped. My history is messy. Old body memories. Attachment stuff. We only recently started slow trauma work. He keeps me inside a window I can actually stay in. I still fog out. Progress feels like inches.\n\nWeeks back I told him my head was throwing violent sexual images with him in them. Scary and, in a twisted way, arousing. I went home and poured the worst parts into a late night note because carrying it alone felt heavier. He had a break after that and I was sure I would come back to a polite goodbye.\n\nThis week he opened with it looks like we are finally inside the work. We named the attachment patterns. We named both flavors of transference, the role flip and the erotic one. I said you read it and you are still here. He said he hears trauma speaking through me, not a wish list, and he is not afraid of it. He can hold it with me. It hit me how much the frame matters.\n\nMost “just set boundaries” advice skips what this actually feels like in the room. There is an AMA tonight with an LMFT on staying regulated when triggers and transference show up, and on keeping boundaries when people pleasing spikes. I want to ask how to keep going when this hits without breaking the container. If you want to listen or drop a question, the group is here https://chat.whatsapp.com/KsGs3C3Bz7tLGDuVCSuIZV?mode=ems_copy_t\n\nHis limits feel like a harbor wall. I can lean and they do not move. When I spike he orients me back to ground. Steady and kind.\n\nPosting to say there are clinicians who meet this without panic, who understand why it appears and work with it instead of punishing you for saying it out loud.

I have experienced SA. \n\nMy therapist and I have been starting trauma exposition altho we are yet dancing around the line kind off. My T wants me fully present when exposing and I still often dissociate. The process is oh so slow. \nIn July we had an intense session where I told him that I have a lot of flashbacks currently and on top of that I imagine him raping me. Instead of being afraid of the thought it rather aroused me. (Perpetrator and erotic transference) He went on holiday for two weeks after that and I wrote my heart into a 3 page PDF. I don’t want to go into depth, but it was some nasty stuff of things I wish he‘d do to me to hurt me. \n\nI think it was some kind of a test so to speak. Because if we gonna do this exposition stuff.. He cannot leave me in the middle of it. I was sure he‘d leave… but he read it in between sessions and today he looked at me and said:“ Seems we are deep into exposition now, aren‘t we?“ We talked about my feelings, my attachement, the transference.. \n\nAt the end I whispered:“ You read all of it and you decided to stay..“ \nHe answered:“Of course. I know what you have written is just the trauma that speaks out of you. It doesn’t scare me. I can carry that with you“\n\nI want to encourage you that there is the one therapist that IS the right fit for you. The one that is aware of transference and the potential trigger behind it and still is experienced enough to work with it instead of against it. \nMy therapist has boundaries that are like HUGE wall around him. That wall has never trembled once. He said I am allowed to test the boundaries as often as I have to until I understand that he will stand his ground. He will put me back to my place. Firm, but gentle. \n\nI am finally able to heal.",

My anxiety loves to fill my head with reasons as to why someone is late and it often gets me to the thought that they could have died. This time it was actually true. I called my therapist and I got a weird and quiet answer from someone else who sort of sounded like him. He asked who I was, I told him and asked for my therapist, saying that this was his clinical phone number that was posted on his website. He told me that he was his cousin and he regretfully had to inform me that my therapist has died. I was and still am in complete disbelief. This doesn't feel real. I have had a few therapists before, but this one has been my most favourite and comforting and effective therapist. We had just begun doing EMDR session to treat my past traumas, but I've been working with him for nearly a year now. He has always made sure that I feel heard and that everything I tell him was safe with him. He always made me feel appreciated. He even made personalized audio recordings for mindfulness meditations that I could do between our sessions. He has provided me with free sessions because I am so in debt from a series of concussion injuries over the past 5 years. I love this person and their counselling has changed my life immensely in the time that we had together. I am shattered to know that he took his own life. I imagine the weight of all that he was carrying and all that he wanted to do felt like it was too much. He was on a mission to help as many people with their traumas so that they could live with less pain. He has done that for me, and I can't believe his part in my journey has come to such an abrupt and unexpected end. My heart aches and I feel broken right now. (Please know that I do feel safe though, I am so fortunate to have a supportive partner and I will seek other counseling when I feel ready). \n\nThis seems like such an uncommon event, so I turn to you all to ask if anyone can relate. Has this happened to anyone here before? If you feel like you are able, can you share some of your experience with me? What did you do after you found out? How did you cope? What helped you make it through and what didn't? Any support is so greatly appreciated.",

      "body": "Long but hopefully helpful/relatable. Yesterday, I had my termination session with my previous therapist of over a year. I was constantly terrified she was ready to ax me, and despite the fact that we talked about that fear, I still convinced myself to just end things and start with someone new. I mourned for weeks.\n\nTo my surprise, in our last session she actually shared that working with me was like “a breath of fresh air” and that our connection was genuine. She admitted to processing, in her own time, the heavier things I shared—that she didn’t just walk away from the emotional bombs I dropped robotically and that she really cared. It was a huge relief to know that sometimes the vulnerable things we share stick with our therapists and they do their own processing with them. Hearing that made me feel incredibly grateful and humbled to know I wasn’t as alone in dealing with the weight of those secrets. \n\nThere was only so much she could share within the treatment framework without triggering my feelings of being a burden, but in that moment I *really* needed to hear that our work mattered to her on a personal level. The thing that nearly broke me was hearing her voice soften as she said, encouragingly—and almost sadly: “Alien, not everyone in your life is going to leave you.” \n\nIt was such a loaded statement because she knew why I terminated. I understood it as her way of saying, “*I was not going to abandon you*”. \n\nIt was an overarching theme to the session. She asked me to trust that people will stick around if I will allow it. The subtext was deafening. Our relationship, as we both had anticipated, was culminating into the same defensive pattern that I had followed my whole life: ending my relationships before they could end me. \n\nIn earlier sessions she revealed hopes that this treatment might model a new and healthier path for me (I’m really sorry that it didn’t). Yet, she still found a graceful way to investigate the fear behind my decision without making me feel ashamed or judged. Thanking me for my honesty and vulnerability, she reassured me that the way this played out was *okay*. She thought I ultimately used good judgment in deciding to work with a more specialized therapist who I could learn to trust the same. \n\nShe set the bar really fucking high for all of my future therapists—my life is so much better having met her, mainly because she first validated my trauma and also fostered my very first safe space where I got to process a lot of ‘forbidden’ emotions I had never admitted to anyone before. I appreciated that she left the door open for me to drop in again, despite not offering to continue contact with other former clients. My heart is full, I have so much gratitude, and I hope that others with strong attachments to their therapists can feel safe enough to trust that not all of them are actively trying to get rid of us.",

      "body": "I was in the middle of a talk session on BetterHelp with a new therapist. This was our 4th session. About 15 minutes into the call, he turns off the video (red flag). I was telling him about something confidential, and out of nowhere I hear a woman loudly moaning. Unmistakably porn. Obviously he clicked open a pornsite browser or un-muted a porn video.\n\nI just pretended like nothing happened, which was probably a mistake, because he did it again like 5 minutes later, I heard a 'Jerkmates' ad, probably a pop-up to some porn site. I'm deeply disturbed by this. I acted as if I didn't hear anything again because I didn't want the conflict and I didn't want him to know that I knew what just happened. But it was super awkward and he ended the call shortly after.\n\nIs this considered sexual harassment? I reported the issue through their general form when you 'change therapists.' I have also e-mailed contact support twice in the past 4 days, and called their 888 hotline, but I have NOT yet received a response from the BetterHelp team.\n\nThat's why I've turned to Reddit for help. What do I do now? Is there no recourse for sexual misconduct on the BetterHelp platform? Do they not care that their therapists are watching porn during videocalls?\n\nI'm going to ask for a full refund for those sessions, and probably stop using the app. Is this the least that I can do? - or are there legal ramifications for this incident? Misdemeanor or felony charges?\n\nClearly a therapist like this should not be able to continue to work.\n\nAbout me: I have a bachelor's in Psychology. A bachelor's in Communication Studies. An associate's in History. I'm currently applying to a master's program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and thinking of becoming a therapist myself.\n\nI'm not sure how this experience is going to shape how I feel about becoming a therapist one day.",

I was creating life within me and that felt very special. The love I already felt and was going to provide my child reached limits you couldn’t imagine. I was going to parent and love my baby in the ways my own mother couldn’t love me. \n\nAll of that is gone now. All I have is future plans I had imagined, no actual memories. I will never be able to see or hold my baby. \n\nI went to session yesterday feeling emotionally raw and broken. A part of me was embarrassed that I lost the baby. I couldn’t even look her in the face. I wanted to be there, but at the same time I wanted to be alone. I had been alone since the doctor told me the news. I have a hard time asking for what I need, but she always encourages that I reach out for support, no matter who that’s from, and I knew I had to process my grief with someone I trusted the most.\n\nI collapsed into myself on her couch. \nI said,\n“I don’t care how dumb or vulnerable it makes me feel..I just really wish you could hold me right now. I understand that goes against your boundaries. I just want to feel safe.” \nShe asked me what was making me feel unsafe. \nWe sat in silence for a few moments, and I finally worked up the courage to tell her that I lost the baby. \nShe gasped. She told me how sorry she was. And then she asked if she could hug me. I nodded through tears and we both stood up. She wrapped her arms around me, and I collapsed into her, weeping. She gently told me again how sorry she was. She held me for as long as I needed her to. \n\nIt was the only physical contact I had felt since I lost the baby, when the doctor rubbed my shoulder. It was a gesture on a human level that I will never forget and will always be grateful for. I left the session feeling more grounded, but also aware that this grieving process will take time. My therapist showed me care, and in turn, I know I have the strength to care for myself while also letting others in. \nThanks for reading and allowing me to process my feelings.",

However, after digesting the situation and what she said, and interacting with some of the lovely people in the comments section of my last post, I made a little decision.\n\nWhen I got home from work, I went into my sister’s room with a slip of paper from work and said my managers gave me something and I’m not quite sure what to make of it and asked if she could look at it for me and maybe she could tell me. She seemed a little confused and went “…okay” and looked at it for a moment then realized it was an approved request (signed by my supervisor + union representative) for a 7 day vacation the week before school starts back up for her at the end of the month.\n\nShe gasped out loud and excitedly did a jump hug on me and I told her she had the playbook for the whole thing and we could go into the city every day or just sit at home if it was what she wanted. Then she started crying and well, not even gonna lie I started crying a bit.\n\nIn the end, I’m really happy we had that session. It’s really good to know she still values time with me and (seemingly) isn’t angry with me for how much I’ve been working and in hindsight, I’m touched she cared about our relationship enough to communicate that to me.\n\nSo yeah, I have the best baby sister in the world and ya boys giving her a vacation to plan 😎\n\n(ps, something I lied to her about…the vacation I’m taking is unscheduled time off since I didn’t have enough saved up for the whole week. I told her I’m gonna be on paid vacation leave for the week so she wouldn’t stress about a week I wasn’t working, but hey, sometimes a white lie is ok :) )",

      "title": "My psychologist ghosted me to teach me a lesson.",
      "body": "I had seen this psychologist 11 times over the course of about 8 months in 2019/2020. He was consistently late to every session (both in-person and virtual) but always prompt about ending the session on time which bugged me but, since it was just a matter of a few minutes, I tolerated it.\n\nOur last session was a virtual one in September 2020. I logged in five minutes before the start time and waited. After I had been waiting for 17 minutes (at which point he was 12 minutes late) I got fed up and decided I was sick of his tardiness, so I closed the browser and no-showed. To be clear, I still paid for this session even though I did not attend it. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I've been really struggling and having a hard time finding another doctor, so I decided to give him another shot. I made an appointment (he has switched back to in-person sessions) and texted him the day before to confirm.\n\nThe next morning, I showed up but his office was locked and the lights were off. I called him, no answer. I texted, no response. Nothing. I instantly had a feeling like I had been ghosted, but constant feelings of abandonment are common with my condition so I tried to put that thought out of my mind. I tried to remind myself that he's a professional, that it makes no sense for a *psychologist* of all people would resort to that kind of petty tit-for-tat...and decided instead to assume he was dealing with a personal emergency and would get back to me when he could. \n\nFast forward again to yesterday. It had been 16 days since the scheduled appointment and I'd not heard anything from him until he called me and \\~very kindly\\~ left a voicemail saying he would be happy to start fresh if I had learned to respect other people's time, and if that was the case then I was welcome to book another appointment with him. \n\nI mean. I just. Wow.\n\nOn the one hand, he's got a point, I shouldn't have no-showed and I had even been planning to apologize and explain my reasoning during the session *he* no-showed for. On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a waste of his time - he was conducting virtual sessions from his home. It's not like he got up, got dressed, and drove to the office only to be stood up - *as I had.* And he was still paid for the session just the same as if I had shown up. Forgive me for saying it, but our no-shows were not the same. \n\nSo I declined the offer. I'm not interested in seeing a psychologist who engages in exactly the kind of retaliatory behavior that I'm trying to fix in myself. \n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this post. But has anyone else experienced something like this?",

      "body": "Am I wrong in thinking this message from my therapist is inappropriate? Was my response reasonable?\n\nWas I wrong to feel this message from my therapist is inappropriate? Was my response reasonable?\n\nSome background; I have been seeing her for almost four years. I went through a messy divorce and a pretty toxic relationship after and acknowledge that she helped me a great deal. \n\nRecently however, I’ve been doing much better mentally, started a new healthy romantic relationship, have worked on some communication issues I had, and also resolved some issues with my best friend. I have also had an increase in obligations for work and church and in my personal life. She also changed her hours and so I had to go from a weekly appointment at a set time and day to making an appointment every week that would vary in time and day each week, along with FaceTime as my only option (she wasn’t doing in person sessions in the evening). I also felt that I was basically going to just review my week every week rather than actually being challenged or working on anything related to my mental health. I also mentioned in passing that I was discerning a call to the diaconate/priesthood with my church; I never asked for her advice on that process, just discussed it as something that was happening.  I had tried broaching the subject of reducing my therapy several times and she basically ignored me and redirected the session to something else. \n\nSo, after doing some thinking I sent a message last night that I was considering stopping therapy because of the above reasons. She messaged me a very curt message and said that I had until 8am to let her know if I was coming to my session this week (this was sent at 11:30pm last night). I wanted to take some time to think about it and then got very busy at work today (I’m a nurse) and wasn’t able to give this the attention I wanted to, so I did not message her back. The message I included came at 4pm.  I was shocked and took a bit to respond but sent the response I included (minus identifying information).\n\nI am genuinely curious to know if anyone has experienced anything like this with a therapist. Or if there is a perspective in either her message that I’m not seeing.  I felt that my response was reasonable, but is it? \n\nI am “emotionally and psychologically” mature enough to know that I certainly benefited from her expertise and from therapy and can separate this experience from my overall positive experience of therapy, should I chose to resume therapy with another therapist.  \n\nThanks!",

      "body": "EDIT: I’m putting this right at the top so people who haven’t read this can see the edit first. I have been told that my post comes off as insensitive and one sided. Obviously not my intention. This sub should be a safe space to discuss ALL things about Therapy/therapists. If you have doubts about your therapist please share them. Don’t ignore your gut. It is important. This is not intended to shame anyone, or discourage anyone from talking about their feelings here. It was merely to remind people that we are ultimately responsible for our own healing and therapists are professionals that help us do that, but it can also be important to recognize that they are people with feelings as well, and they are not perfect. Sometimes we can get caught up in our own stuff and forget that - which happens with people who’ve experienced various degrees of trauma/unhealthy attachments and that’s OKAY. I am just saying that we should remember that therapists are humans who have boundaries and it is perfectly normal for them to set boundaries with their clients for many reasons and I have seen many people in this sub seem to push things that seem like basic client/therapist boundaries (though everyone has different boundaries with their own T’s)\n\nI have no clue how this is going to be received in this sub and I hope this is allowed… I want to start by saying I am not a therapist. I’ve been in therapy on and off since I was about 13 and I am now 28. I have been seeing my therapist for a few years now and we have a good relationship, but I’ve seen lots of therapists that I either did not like at all and were horrible, or just didn’t feel like I was making any progress with.\n \nI feel like almost every day I’m seeing posts on this sub about how people think their therapists don’t care about them when they take too long to respond or forget something they said, that they’re not responding to texts outside of sessions, and I even saw one where someone was upset and jealous that their therapist had other clients.\n \nI understand that we see therapists because we need help, and some of these things mentioned above could be manifestations of attachment issues, trauma etc… and I am not discounting that at all. I am ALSO not shaming anyone asking for help on whether or not their therapist did something wrong, or getting (hopefully) un-biased opinions from this sub. That’s what it’s for!\n \nBut I just feel like I’ve seen a lot of stuff on this sub lately complaining that their therapists aren’t at their sole beck and call immediately when they think they need them...\n \nYour therapist is a person, just like you. They’re human beings with friends, families, problems, and lives outside of their jobs as therapists. They have other clients – that doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. They have multiple people they are trying to help through trauma/issues. That would be difficult and draining! Don’t you think?\n \nAs someone with CPTSD I find my own problems exhausting, I can’t imagine having to help multiple people work through various problems as my job and also deal with my own issues. Which is another reason why I think *most* of these people are wonderful. They chose a difficult career because they want to help people. I think as people on the other side of therapy we forget that because we are so consumed with our problems we forget that our therapists are people.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has forgotten something I’ve told her. I forget things people tell me sometimes too. Because I’m a human.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has not gotten back to my email or text immediately. I leave texts and emails unanswered sometimes too, even when I mean to answer them. Because I’m a human.\n \nThere have been times that my therapist has said something I didn’t like. I’m positive I say things people don’t like. All. The. Time. Because I’m a human. (That’s why communicating this with them is important but that’s another topic).\n \nI just feel like I needed to say this here. Therapists can really suck, if you have a bad one, but just because your therapist isn’t perfect doesn’t mean you should look for a new one, or give up on therapy, because they’re just people. They want to help, and they try to help as many people as they’re capable of while also having their own lives.\n \nI ALSO want to clarify – this is not a “your problems aren’t bad enough” post and is not meant to shame ANYONE. I just think that as human beings we owe it to other human beings to recognize that we are ALL humans and none of us are perfect. There is a standard we need to hold our therapists to as therapists yes, but I think there are a lot of unrealistic standards that some folks hold their therapists to as PEOPLE.\n \nIt is healthy for us to recognize that they are other people and not just a tool for us to improve our own lives, and I think that it could be helpful to try and remember that the next time your therapist does something that is off-putting to you (that doesn’t violate any codes of conduct obviously).",

      "body": "in case people missed it we moved my session up to yesterday thank god.\n\nok so first things first thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. It was really helpful to read through everything and get different opinions on stuff :)\n\nI had therapy and talked to the guy (who's name I'm not gonna say,) and both of them went better than I was expecting. I guess i'll start with my session...idk how many details you guys are interested in so it might get kinda long sorry. So it was a little awkward, but she was super nice about everything and said she kind of panicked too, and that her and her coworkers could have never imagined something like this happening lol. We talked about like how I felt about seeing her outside of her office (more specifically the fact that I was accidentally at her house) and what that like \"brought up\" for me, and then she told me that when she went upstairs she was talking to colleagues and reaching out to her supervisor like you all said she probably was. She told me that she didn't (and couldn't) tell her son anything about it (or about anything i've ever shared with her), so we talked through what a conversation with him might look like and how he could react and stuff. Luckily she said she thinks it's great that we're dating and she can't really do anything to stop us either way, it's just sad that it's so complicated, and we talked through how it might feel seeing her outside of therapy if I did keep dating him. So finally at the end we came up with a game plan. Whether I keep dating her son or not we both decided it would be best to transfer out, and she already had picked out one of her coworkers that she thought would be a good fit for me who works like in the same office place thing, just on different days than she's there so I don't have to see her in a \"therapeutic setting\" at all. I signed some like disclosure forms or something so she could talk to the other therapist about what we've been working on and stuff, and I thought that would be it, but I'm gonna see her one more time next week and the other therapist is going to come in so we can talk to her together cause I'm more comfortable with that, and then I'll officially start seeing the new one the week after. The good news is that as far as mental health goes my issues are pretty generic (anxiety/depression, adhd, and some self harm stuff that I've mostly worked through) so switching won't be super difficult. Like obviously it'll be an adjustment but I think i'll live probably.\n\nNow for the update about talking to her son:\nI asked him if we could meet up to talk and he said yes. So pretty much i was just like \"hey so this is really weird but your mom is/was actually my therapist and I had no idea until last weekend when you introduced me i'm so sorry and totally understand if you want to end things\" and then filled him in on more details. He obviously thought it was a little strange, but was as understanding as you could be in this situation (thank god for a therapist mom) and apparently he thought something was off because of how we both acted and how I left so fast after \"meeting\" her. We talked about what to do and he said it's a little weird, but it doesn't bother him enough that he'd want to break up as long as i'm still comfortable with it, which I am for now at least. The thing we decided though is that at least for a while we're gonna sort of avoid his house and just hang out at mine and like around other places until i get settled in with the new therapist so that it'll hopefully be a little less weird when we do go to his house. We also agreed to talk to each other if it did end up being too much for one of us, but for right now we're both ok with everything. \n\nSo overall things went really well. I guess it  sucks that I have to switch therapists, but i'm really glad I can still date her son because I really like him and he's super nice and i'm glad I didn't have to choose between them because I had to change therapists either way. Thanks again for everyone's advice/support, and i'll keep you all updated if things change!",

I saw her tearing up and she ended up crying. Generally, she is rarely extremely expressive.\n\nI am a clinical psychology grad student myself and in general it is accepted that therapists should remain neutral.

My daughter and I went back and forth with the therapist mediating, and then things started to get heated and she told me “no more bullshit” and asked if I was disappointed or embarrassed by her, and she insisted I gave a yes or no answer and no “pussyfooting” answer. I told her that if she had asked me that two weeks ago, the answer would’ve been a resounding yes. However, then I realized I have a healthy and beautiful daughter who lives with me and talks to me, and she’s found love and is working close to what she loves (art) so now that I’m seeing her from the correct angle. I don’t know what there isn’t to be proud of. I then told her I’m not proud of the jackass I was two weeks ago and I hoped she could forgive me. She stopped for a moment and then started crying and I hugged her and she hugged me back. She and I went out for lunch afterwards and it was pretty nice.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how old she gets, whenever I see her crying I *always* see my little girl crying. I feel absolutely horrible for making her feel like I was disappointed in her but I’ll take this as a win and a step in the right direction.",

I’m still relatively new to the therapy field, but even in that short time have had the ability to work with many people in many areas of their lives, and have had to say goodbye to all of them. I just had my final session with a client of mine and I thought it would be helpful to know that it’s difficult for us too. It brings up goodbyes with past clients as well. You trust us enough to share your innermost fears and vulnerabilities, something that any decent therapist does not take lightly. That’s not easy to do, especially to someone who you know little about personally. I can only speak for myself, but I’m guessing most therapists would agree that we care about you just as much as you care about us. If I say you’ve made an impact in my life, I mean it wholeheartedly. You are not just a paycheck, you are a person who was a meaningful part of my life for a time, and will continue to be even after our time working together has concluded. Saying goodbye is hard for us too.",

      "body": "**edit: Ah, i forgot to attach one of the screenshots—\n\nAfter my first initial text in the first screenshot, I stated: “I also wasn't aware when making the appointment that it would be a video consultation and not a phone consultation. I also wasn't aware of your 48 hour cancellation policy when I originally booked the appointment, so l would appreciate if I wasn't charged for cancelling given this info. Thanks”\n\nThey responded with: “ Hi. All of this information is on the website and it's also sent to you and in your client portal so that you can read it ahead of time. so I'm not sure what to say if you're not aware, but I do prompt people to read the information before they even set the consult and your email confirmation says video consultation as what you selected. Phone consultation is not even in the drop down menu. Anyway, it was already canceled and I no longer have avallability. All the best.”\n\nTo which i responded with slide two.**\n\n——————————-\n\nSome context: I have been searching for a therapist and decided to book a consult call with this provider. I am just a bit taken aback by her response.\n\nFirst, it does not state on their website that they charge for a 15 minute consult call. I was under the impression that it was common practice to have free 15 minute consultation calls to see if a good provider patient relationship is there. Again, no where did it state that it costed 25 dollars for a 15 minute video call.\n\nI called the provider twice to cancel, no answer. This is the only way to cancel.\n\nAnother thing—video calls are $25, phone calls are free. This was made known to me after booking and reading the terms and conditions. There was only an option to book a video.\n\nI have 4 therapy consult calls set up for the next coming weeks and none of them charge. Is this industry standard? Not sure why this provider reacted like this. Am in the wrong tho?",

      "body": "In essence, my thesis is exactly the title - we should not, whenever Covid slithers off into the beyond, accept teletherapy as the new normal. And by “we”, I mean clients, and potential clients, of therapy - and, let’s face it, everyone is a potential client of therapy.\n\nIn my opinion, teletherapy is a much reduced service from a client perspective. It is no substitute for the healing and feeling of safety that can be present when the therapist and client are physically in the same room. It is devoid of the level of healing energy that can come from two people physically occupying the same space.\n\nThis is not to say that therapists have not done trojan work at a time of huge uncertainty in facilitating teletherapy, nor is it to say that there is no effort involved in providing therapy over a virtual platform. Nor is it even to say that teletherapy cannot help and have positive outcomes. But it is not a good normal. I see so many posts on this subreddit from clients of various forms of teletherapy who seem to be struggling with issues with their therapist that would present as far less problematic and much easier to resolve in face to face therapy. And then, I read so many posts on the Pyschotherapy subreddit where therapists speak of their decision to never return to face to face -  virtual overheads are cheaper, it’s more flexible etc... As clients, we need to ensure we understand that our time, potential for change and money are valuable (and sometimes finite) resources. We should not, in a post Covid world, accept a reduced service as the normal.\n\nI feel very lucky that I was seeing my therapist for a number of years prior to Covid, we both feel that teletherapy is no substitute for in-person. We are happy that we can continue our sessions in this manner until we can safely resume in-person sessions, but neither of us believe what we are doing to be ideal. Post-Covid, there is definitely a space for teletherapy as a tool, but in a toolbox that hangs off the primacy of the physical therapy room. Teletherapy could be used occasionally as various needs arise amongst clients and therapists (or for specific cohorts of clients for whom face to face is not an option) but not as the main event.\n\nAs clients of therapy we need to be very careful that a temporary solution does not become the normal.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Edit: some really great replies, from all perspectives, here. It’s an area that deserves a lot of thought, and much discussion. \\*\\*\\*",

Instead of just giving me strategies to counter them, she asked me to choose a small rock from a bowl and told me to carry it with me. I chose a smooth blue quartz-like one.\n\nThe idea? Every time I catch myself slipping into that negative cycle, I touch the rock. Not as a punishment or a grounding exercise in the traditional sense, but as a physical reminder: *I have a choice here. I matter.* I can keep going down the same self-destructive path, or I can pause, acknowledge the thought for what it is, and try to shift it.\n\nIt sounds so simple, but honestly, it’s been helping so much. The weight of the rock in my pocket makes me more aware of when I’m being cruel to myself. Sometimes, just feeling it is enough to snap me out of autopilot and remind me that I don’t *have* to believe every horrible thing my brain says about me. Honestly, it's been extremely helpful.

Came across this page in a children’s book today and burst into tears thinking about her.\n\nDetailed explanation:\n\nI have to read children’s picture books frequently for work, and I probably only tear up over a story a couple of times a year. I guess I’m starting 2025 early because this one really got me.\n\nI walked into my therapist’s office at the start of 2023 looking for an autism evaluation that I expected would only last a few sessions. I ended up staying with her for 2 years to talk about the rest of my dumpster fire of a life after she confirmed my suspicions about autism.\n\nHer guidance led me to finally graduating college after 7 years, a PTSD diagnosis, realizing and escaping an abusive 3-year relationship, and getting my very first place to live on my own.\n\nAs soon as I moved out and tried to experience my first taste of freedom, my brain realized it was also the first time it had ever known safety, which apparently made it the perfect time to unleash decades of buried trauma memories like some kind of sick, spring-loaded, snake-in-a-can prank.\n\nI socially isolated myself, lost 40 pounds, and became so sleep-deprived from the intense stress and anxiety that I was dropping to the floor of my apartment mid-stride at 6am. I was written up once at work for running out of PTO, but somehow managed to keep my job through all of this. Things have calmed down a bit now and I’m trying to figure out who I even am underneath all the trauma, symptoms, and disorders.\n\nI told my therapist I couldn’t have done any of this without her. Of course, she wouldn’t take any credit and turned it back on me. I didn’t argue with her, but I disagree. This is where today’s book comes in.\n\nThe title is “Lighthouse and the Little Boat” by Katie Frawley, and the plot reminds me a bit of the parable of the prodigal son. For anyone unable to view the image, it’s the page from the book that made me use up one of my annual crying passes less than 3 weeks into the year.\n\nA tattered boat barely makes it home safe to the harbor. She gets lost in a terrible storm and finds her way out thanks to the lighthouse. She says, “Lighthouse, you saved me.” The lighthouse responds, “No. You saved yourself. I only lit the way.”\n\nThank you to all the therapists out there for your life-changing work, even if you won’t admit that’s what you’re doing. ♥️",

      "body": "UPDATE:\n\nThank you all for your responses. Your feedback provided me with a lot more clarity, which has helped give me a lot more acceptance. I absolutely have no interest in reporting this incident. My former therapist owns her own practice with her husband, and I believe that situation was very nuanced and that she did everything she determined to be the most ethical for my care. Personally, as someone training to be a therapist, it really stresses to me the importance of regular supervision for ethical care of our clients. I know some people were concerned for my wellbeing, especially in my DMs, I did learn a ton of coping skills in my time with my therapist, so I’m handling it. It’s been rough, because I have some really intense emotional wounds that were reopened. Trauma thoughts definitely like to focus on self-sabotage and self-blame, but I do have all the tools I need to work through it. Thank you for taking the time to read, to offer comfort, or to provide feedback. My request is any further commentary is there to provide compassion and understanding to both sides of the coin for any future therapists and clients reading that may be in a similar situation. \n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nI’ve been working with my therapist for 3.5 years. My background is pretty heavy, so lots of unpacking trauma. We were currently talking about having me explore my creative side again after shutting out writing for a really long time. She mentioned a book about women finding creativity from their “womb” energy, and I didn’t really resonate with the suggestion. I told her that I feel like many women don’t have a womb or may have health issues that would impact their abiiity to feel connected to that part of their body and asked if she had another suggestion. My therapist got very defensive and upset with me, and said that I shifted the conversation  to bring up a conflict with her. The vibe change was shocking. I had never seen her act this way in all our time working together. I began sobbing, apologizing for offending her, but utterly confused. \n\nAfter a week, I reached out to schedule a session again despite still feeling super confused about what transpired. Immediately into the session, she shared that she sought council, and didn’t realize she had so much countertransference. She said we were similar people with similar issues, so she could no longer be my therapist. She said she shared the situation with her husband, who is also a therapist, and that he was willing to meet with me in the meantime before I find someone new… which that suggestion made me feel very uneasy. She seemed like she hating being there talking to me at all… so while crying I asked if I should just go and she said fair, yeah, you can go.\n\nAnd that’s where we left it. 3.5 years of finally finding a therapist I felt I could trust, building a rapport and going through so much while leaning on this person… to then feel like she despises me. I’m so confused and in shock. I feel that her discussing me with her husband feels like a confidentiality breech despite him being a therapist too. I always had her in my corner to talk to, and now that’s gone, because of one opinion that I shared causing so much distress? The first half of that “conflict” session even was going really well and had me feeling really supported. I just would love any insight on…. What happened here? Is this normal? Where do I go from here? I feel completely lost. I’ve physically thrown up at times, I feel as though someone close to me has died. The realization that I absolutely cannot talk to her ever again after sharing things I’ve never shared with anyone… it just is making me feel so sick and so exposed. I feel totally fucked up.\n\nIf you read this, thank you, because I just need a place to soundboard and help gain some understanding.",

      "title": "Therapy Is Weird: The Milestones of the First Year",
      "body": "Happy First Therapyversary To Meeeee!\n\nIt's been quite a year, my friends. For all of us. And as I approach a year of therapy (today!), I can't help but reflect on what a weird-ass trip it's been. Now, I know everyone's therapy experience is different. Like, *vastly* different. But I also know that there are those out there who have been through, or are in the midst of, that rollercoaster of a first year, and can relate to some of this. So. Indulge me, people. It's a long one, but it's kinda fun.\n\ntl;dr: Therapy Is Weird.\n\n**THE MANY MILESTONES OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THERAPY**\n\n^((As told by an anxious, panic-prone, trauma denier))\n\n**1. The Intro, Where I Pretend To Be Mostly Normal**\n\n\"Hi, I'm Selfless! I'm a pretty average professional person who's just, you know, low-key nervous about Covid! So happy to meet you!\" I said, while sitting in a chair at a desk like a sane human. I actually think my therapist literally said, \"Yeah, we'll see.\" The nerve of that guy.\n\n**2. Oh. Shit.**\n\nMy first in-therapy panic attack came during our third session, over telehealth, as I sat in the corner of my office holding the laptop where no one could see me. It took me off guard, was humiliating, and confusing, and exhausting, and over *effing* telehealth. I was ready to not come back. The next session, I showed up and said, \"I'm really sorry about that last session.\" He said, \"What the hell do you think therapy is for? I know it was painful for you, but really, Selfless. Bring it on. You're not a burden.\" I was thinking: Just you wait, Mister T. You're going to eat those words.\n\n**3. Trying to Prove You're Worth Their Time**\n\nRemember when your therapist person listened to you talk, gave you \"unconditional positive regard,\" and you were like, nope. I don't deserve *this* kind of attention. No way. Too good to be true. This person seems smart and put together and there's no way I'm worth all this kindness. But maybe I can try to earn it by being the best. Client. Ever. *(Panic-Googles \"How to be the best therapy client ever\" and reads everything.)*\n\n**4. When You Google Your Therapist And Feel Like a Total Creep**\n\nAnd speaking of Googling... I actually thought I was the first person who did this. Which is hilarious, now. The stupid part is, the dude's internet presence is squeaky-clean. I found his Pinterest page and discovered that he likes s'mores a lot, so much there's a whole board dedicated to them (a S'morgasboard? Thank you. Thank you.) And that was about it. And I felt like a total gross stalker person. And then posted here about it, and everyone reassured me that everyone does this. Thanks, everyone.\n\n**5. \"You're going to quit on me and when you do I will surely die.\"**\n\nI didn't say it, but I thought it for weeeeeks. Months? Maybe. And when I say \"thought about it,\" I mean obsessed over it daily. He's going to die/quit/hate me/move/or never have existed in the first place, and then I will probably perish in a puddle of abandoned shame. He must have sensed this, since that's kind of his job, and said, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" And I was like \"I'll believe it when I see it, chump.\" And then...\n\n**6. First Cancellation**\n\nA few weeks later, the receptionist called me a few hours before my appointment, telling me it was canceled. And suddenly, I was the person who cries pathetically on the phone with the receptionist. She must have called Mister T and said, \"Sir, I just talked to your crazy client and she's being crazy,\" because I got a call ten minutes later: \"Heyyy, Selfless. It's your therapist. I'm sorry I had to cancel on you today. I just wanted to tell you that I'm ok, and ask if there was anything you needed to talk about.\" And that's when I became the person who cries pathetically on the phone with two people in one day.\n\n**7. The Day You Find Out Your Parents Weren't Perfect And Your Childhood Was Cray**\n\nAppointment one, I straight-up told Mister T I had an idyllic childhood. Like, that it was perfect. He gave me a very doubtful \"huh.\" And I was like, *how dare you.* And then months later, after reading two short essays I wrote about my relationships with my parents and siblings and how I processed all of my emotions in my closet, he slowly and gently, like a social-working ninja, helped me realized that my childhood was just as fucked up as everyone else's. And I was pissed. (But he was right.)\n\n**8. First Cryptic Email**\n\nI had a med adjustment half a year into therapy that ruined my eva-lovin' mind. Like, immediately. (Everyone else who has experienced this put yo hands up! It suuuucks!) It was a weekend, and I was desperate, and I sent Mister T. the first non-business email I've ever sent him, full of weirdly-worded cries for help and downplayed suicidal ideation. It was embarrassing. And I apologized ASAP. Told him I knew it was inappropriate and I only sent it to him because I was pretty sure he wouldn't read it. And he called it what it was and said, you proooobably aaaaactually sent it to me because you trust me and needed a safe place for your scary thoughts. And I was like fine, know-it-all.\n\n**9. The Day Your T Recommends A Psych Eval**\n\nIt's a terrible feeling when your therapist tells you that a different psychologist person needs to hear about all your shit so they can draw some medically-worded conclusions.\n\n**9.5. Post-Eval Anxiety Sesh**\n\nThis is the common occurrence where you have to process the fact that the psychologist who evaluated you thought you were being oppressed by demons. Oh. Wait. That doesn't happen to most people? Nm then.\n\nAlso, though, one of my tests came back invalidated because of \"possible over-reporting.\" I immediately emailed Mister T begging him not to read the results. Because what if he never trusted me again? What if he trusted \"Dr. You're-a-demon-possessed-liar, PsyD\" instead? Writing it out, it doesn't make much sense. When I showed up to our session, Mister T held up the report and said, \"I'm so fucking frustrated with this guy.\" Phew.\n\n**10. Convincing Your T You're Not Ok**\n\nThere was one session where my therapist told me he was excited to talk himself out of a job. My heart rate jumped by like 100 bpm. Ummmmm nope. You're on retainer for life, my friend. And in case you're not convinced, here's a really cool panic attack I made, just for you. See, look how messed up I still am? Please stay forever.\n\n**11. The Day You Both Figure Out Why You're So Not Ok**\n\nI'm actually not sure how common this is, but I didn't identify my own trauma as trauma for a good 8 months. I thought it was so normal that *I had not even mentioned it.* And as soon as it started coming out, we were both relieved. Kinda horrified, definitely overwhelmed, but also relieved. Because suddenly, all this anxiety and panic and stress made a whole lot more sense to both of us. Our sessions were more focused. The puzzle pieces fit. Then, we started doing therapy frrealz.\n\n**12. When The Masks Come Off. The Actual, Literal, Covid Masks (and the Other Ones)**\n\nThe first session in-person, where we took off our masks, was hella weird. Just the most awkward thing ever. It was almost too real, and too intense. I had made Mister T into some two-dimensional cartoon character, and suddenly he was an actual man with a *mouth*. (And then a goose scared me at the window. That pushed me over the edge.)\n\nBut just as Covid-masks coming off made things a realer shade of real, so did the removal of the metaphorical masks. There was the day I finally called the trauma, trauma, and called the abuse, abuse. There was the day Mister T had not slept and dropped some serious truth-bombs because he was too tired for my bullshit. There was a lot of mutual humanness, and I know there will be a lot more.\n\nBecause therapy is weird, you guys, but I'm a much \"me-er me\"\\* (\\*that's a Mister T trademark) after a year of it than I ever imagined I could be. So I encourage all of you to push through the awkward. Get to the truth. Know you're not a creep, know you're worth their time, forgive yourself for the cryptic emails and insecurities and continue onward. This is hard work, but it's worth doing.",

      "body": "I’ve been seeing my therapist for over a year now. I’ve been feeling increasingly depressed over the past few weeks and mentioned at this session how I felt I was possibly doing “worse” due to feeling the highlighted discrepancy between feeling the pain of past trauma and the pressure to “just get over what happened” he asked for clarification about “what happened?”. I replied “uhh the trafficking??” And he is like “what are you talking about you never told me that??”.  \n\nThe session just kind of fell apart after that. I was weeping and feeling disoriented and in disbelief. I expressed feeling justified in my belief that the world doesn’t care what happened to me. He was in damage control mode and offered apologies that “IF” I truly had told him then he dropped the ball..and “IF” I had truly told him then he was sorry. But he went on to state that there are two people involved in the therapeutic relationship and the causation of ruptures are from both ends. At that point I told him I needed to leave and that I was being asked to take accountability for what wasn’t mine, but was his. I told him I needed time to see if the work could even continue. I left sobbing. \n\nLater that night he emailed me to let me know what I already knew. (That he checked his notes from our initial meeting and I did in fact tell him). I replied that I already knew that and it wasn’t that he forgot something I told him a year ago, but that it’s foundational to the work that I am doing and shaped my entire way of being. I referenced multiple other sessions where I spoke about it and let him know that his failure wasn’t in forgetting something once, it was in failing to listen to me at all. \n\nYall I’m devastated. I’m 38 now, the trafficking happened from 15-17 and I’m JUST NOW beginning to be able to poke the edges of that wound. I wasted a year plus of expensive sessions in the hopes that I could restore some faith in the world and that my pain mattered to someone.  I paid him to pretend it mattered and it STILL couldn’t be done.  \n\nI’m feeling incredibly isolated, like more damage has been done and now I am without resources to process this. (And incredibly reluctant to ever trust the therapy process again). I’ve also switched from freeze to fawn mode and am preoccupied with worrying about if he’s mad at me, if this makes me a “bad” client, etc. What would be helpful to me is if others could chime in with whether this is as big a betrayal as it seems.  ( I’m open to the idea that I’m being hypersensitive due to the pain of the original trauma). I’d love any form of support or suggestions about how to personally heal from this.",

However, I was on twitter recently and their algorithm suggested people to follow. And one was my therapist. \n\nI was completely shocked by what I saw. He seems to be an ultra right wing transphobe and white supremacist.\n\nI looked at his tweets, his replies to other people’s tweets and also tweets he has liked and I’m floored. \n\nI absolutely am not shy to debate and I welcome the opinions of others. But my goodness he says things about how the problems in certain countries are  entirely due to black people, makes horrible comments about trans people and once belittled a mother of an autistic child as being overly needy. \n\nHe aligns himself with a lot of very dodgy right wing commentators who are favour a return to white western values.\n\nHas anyone encountered anything like this before and how did you handle it?\n\nNever once has he expressed anything like this in our sessions. Our sessions always been productive and professional. However I can’t continue seeing him. I have no respect for him anymore and wouldn’t be able to get through a session without thinking of how he hates many types of people and how aggressive he is to them. \n\nI’m also not sure if this warrants a complaint to his employer or if that’s taking it too far?\n\nI’d love to know your thoughts. \n\nPS I’m an Asian gay man in case that context is helpful.",

      "body": "I see posts romanticizing the therapeutic relationship. Maybe people doting after their therapists or with inner conflicts around flirtations.\n\nI went down that road and this post is to tell you that everything you google is true. I was love bombed and sucked into a terrible relationship. I was pregnant with a child by the time I wanted to leave. He would taunt me that there were no records. He would joke that no one else would believe it. A relationship so verbally and emotionally abusive it’s broken my life. \n\nThere is an innate power imbalance and they will use it against you, over and over in ways you don’t understand at first. I insisted to my friends and family that it was fine, how dare they be upset at an age gap. \nWhat I could never explain to them was that he treated me for wanting to take a gun to my head from my history of sexual abuse as a child. He saw me as being worthy of something I called love and I thought that finally meant I wasn’t so worthless anymore. \n\nThe romantic relationships I had while being treated by him were discouraged, put down, and ultimately ended. Then went my family. He discouraged me from speaking with them because they didn’t understand him. My friends went too, over time. \n\nIt wasn’t until there were tears streaming down my face as I begged to leave that I realized how bad it all had gotten. That he stole everything from me. My self worth. Confidence. Trust. \n\nI always knew something was wrong but didn’t want to face it. I knew this even starting was taboo but initially it seemed hot and exciting. It’s faded to its true meaning now. Cold, bitter, and desolate. Im stuck with him forever now. \n\nI’ve submitted a complaint but who knows if any board would even care at this point. The evidence is there but someone could just as easily call me out as a spiteful ex wife. Who knows what would be more painful - leaving or having no one believe me. \n\nTLDR: got into a relationship with my therapist. Abusive and manipulative just like the internet tells you. Avoid it.",

      "body": "Tl;dr: I contacted a therapist I hadn’t seen in almost a dozen years not expecting a reply. I got one a week later. But to be on the safe side, don’t get your hopes up.\n\nI stopped seeing a therapist 11 years ago and I don’t live in the same city anymore. Last month, I was driving my mother somewhere and we happened to be in the immediate vicinity of that therapist’s office and ex-T came across my mind. I felt all of that kindness, empathy, and care shown towards me in my “younger days” and I couldn’t let it go. I felt this visceral need to connect with her human-to-human, one more time. \n\nI googled her and emailed her last week. I went into this knowing that I could handle never getting a reply. I told her that I didn’t know if she remembered me. I was honest and told her where I got her email address and that I was aware of possibly shouting into a void. (I believe I was toughened up against not getting replies after my IOP program last year. 3 people I happened to really like gave out their email addresses when they left, I contacted them, and they never wrote back. I felt really hurt and it took a long time to get over it.)\n\nI went on to tell her my impetus for contacting her (the stuff I related above) and gave her a brief rundown of what has happened in my life since then…almost none of it good, unfortunately. I told her that I was in good hands with a therapist and a psychiatrist/med regimen. I ended with an anecdote from one of our very last sessions. I told her that I was in a gutter of depression and she paid me what I considered to be one of the highest compliments a patient can receive from their therapist - she told me I was someone she would consider to be a friend had we not met in this context. I told her that thinking about that still made me emotional, and signed off with “anyway, I’m still here.”\n\nSent. I moved on.\n\nShe wrote back 7 days later, you guys. She did remember me! She went on to tell me that she still had a piece of artwork that I had made in college, which I had completely forgotten about. (It was probably a Xmas gift or something.) She thanked me for writing, catching up, and said she was impressed with the amount of work I was doing for my overall health. \n\n“I will never forget you and our working relationship. …I was delighted to hear from you. I wish you all the best. Thanks for checking in. That meant a lot to me. Warm regards.”\n\nThat made my night. I’m proud of myself for being so vulnerable despite the possibility of being disappointed. And by the way, I realized that my parade of not-so-great things over the last 11 years was a self audit when I look back on it now, and I am trying to reframe that as a “both…and” kind of thing. Some of the events I recounted to her were completely out of my control anyway, like death. \n\nThanks to all of you T’s out there",

      "body": "A lot of what is said on this sub by therapists does cross lines, and termination is always a safe option. I recognize that I can’t judge what crosses somebody else’s line, also. Sometimes dumping is the only sound advice. \n\nI just notice “dump your T” messages are thrown around on *so* many posts. On a few occasions, I have posted one or two lines of something hurtful my therapist has said, looking for advice on how to address it and cope with it until the next session. However, I get several comments how I should fire them immediately. \n\nMy first thought is that T’s are hard to come by. It’s not easily accessible to find another affordable & compassionate T in your area, and it’s just not possible for everyone to sit on a 6 week waitlist when your health is so volatile. It feels as helpful as responding “move out” when one says they’re living with someone they get into an argument with. \n\nMy second thought is that we are in therapy to learn how to better function, and interpersonal effectiveness is one of the biggest skills to work on. \n\nMy therapist is a human, and a template. I’ve learned look at our disagreements, including her mistakes, as an opportunity to learn healthy confrontation and how to advocate for my needs. (I recognize not all respond well, and I’m lucky that mine does).\n\nFor example- I shared that my T spoke on her vacations, timeshare, boat etc. while my extreme financial struggles cause immense stress in my daily life. I shared on here for advice on how to explain to her how it bothers me. I received so many “leave her” comments and comments attacking her personally, with only one comment suggesting I mention it to her. I chose to speak to her on it and she immediately apologized. She eventually told me that she hadn’t realized how her brief self-disclosures after vacations might effect *all* her clients, and actually thanked me for bringing it up. \n\nI struggle with others in my life in the same way, and it showed me how to approach them about it. I learned a transferable and useful skill that helps me better function on my own. I am so glad I didn’t lose her over that, and that I had the opportunity learn more about confrontation.\n\nTherapists will say things that upset you, and even say/do things that are objectively wrong. If I terminated everytime a therapist said something wrong to me, I would never be able to find a therapist and my mental health would be deteriorated.\n\nEdit: I guess I need to reiterate again that am not against termination, and it’s not bad to fire a therapist. This is my opinion based off of my experiences and a few others I have seen in this sub. This post has nothing to do with bad therapists or therapists you do not click with. I’m suggesting that you speak to your therapist about non-dealbreaker ruptures and disagreements, and to advocate for yourself. I never suggested this was easy, either. I struggle with it a lot. It is a necessary skill for interpersonal communication, though. Because every single therapist will say something wrong at some point",

I didn’t expect him to fully go off on me or anything, but I expected him to be offended and that it would be a hard conversation.

      "body": "Hi everyone, I am currently enrolled in a partial hospitalization program/PHP for my anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues I’ve been having. I just finished my fourth day. Most of the time has been spent in group settings so far. This afternoon the therapist leading our group was discussing mindfulness and handed us two worksheets to fill out while we went on a “scavenger hunt” walk. I filled out the one for the indoors since it’s over 100 degrees outside 😭 I won’t share it here since I wrote on it, but imagine the same format, just for things to notice inside a room. We received a few other worksheets during this time as well. Near the end of the session one participant mentioned using ChatGPT to help make an action plan for goals, and the therapist said she used AI as well to make the worksheets. At first I was confused because I could see the logo from the website that was used for sheets we had just gotten, so I didn’t ask about it. But I did raise an eyebrow at the idea of using ChatGPT in a therapy setting. While on the drive home I realized it was these worksheets that were definitely AI generated!! The emojis, the — use, the random bold words… I felt like such an idiot for not realizing it sooner! \n\nNow I am not here to discuss the ethics of AI, and I’m truly unsure of where to share this post. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this discussion. I recognized the use of ChatGPT because I’ve used it myself before just to mess around. My issue is that I already struggle with mindfulness and now all I can think about is how weird it was to hand out generated worksheets rather than just making one. I paid a lot of money to be in this program and it feels like I’m getting shorted in a way. But my frustration isn’t so tangible that I feel terribly valid in complaining about this. It’s not like a therapist was feeding a LLM everything I was saying. Am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Is part of what I need to accept in this process the incoming technological changes coming? I understand some people use ChatGPT as a therapy tool and this isn’t exactly the same use, but couldn’t I just make one of these at home myself using AI? Thanks for any insight.",

      "body": "I’ve been seeing this therapist since July of 2023, and he’s had to cancel or reschedule our appointments a total of 10 times. He’s also been late to several of my appointments; this Monday, he was late by 20 minutes. I’m really getting sick and tired of constantly feeling like I’m being jerked around by a so-called “professional.” He has been somewhat helpful so far, but the lack of consistency is making me doubt his commitment and respect for my time. I’ve brought this up to him before, yet the issue still persists. It’s actually gotten even worse since he switched to private practice. I plan on bringing it up again today. \n\nAm I wrong for being fed up with this? Or should I have fired this guy a long time ago?",

I feel bad because I know shit happens and she has kids and a family and didn’t get payment for this week’s session. But at least now I can feel some sense of closure for it.",

      "body": "I got the news that my therapist died last night. His colleague wrote me an email. I have no idea how to deal with it. I'm devastated and shaken to my core, and numb and in denial at the same time. I've cried at least five times in the last 24 hours. I'm torn between disbelief and crippling grief. I have essentially no time to process this quietly either because I have a bunch of stuff coming up I can't cancel. I have a support system but I'm still so devastated it feels unbearable. \n\nWe've been working together for almost 3 years. He's hands down the absolute BEST therapist I've ever had. Ever. He's funny and compassionate and so smart and always knows what to say. We were at the point in therapy where we saw each other about once a month/every six weeks just to check in. He was such a constant in my life and I didn't realize how attatched I am until I heard the news of his death and it hit me like a train. \n\nHis colleague said he died \"unexpectedly\" which makes it all so much worse. I cannot stand the thought of that man suffering an accident or heart attack and passing away like that. He has a son too. 15 or 16 years old. It's terrible. Absolutely devastating and I don't know how to deal with it.\n\nThe one small comfort I have is that I told him how much hes helped me in one of our last sessions. I told him what a great therapist he was and how I wouldn't be where I am today without him, not even close. And he genuinely thanked me for it. I'm so glad I told him that when I had the chance. \n\nIt's awful and horrible and overwhelming. I know full well he wouldn't want me to crumble. He would want me to move on with my life and cherish and honor his memory and remember the things hes told me and stay strong. But the grief is still fresh and blooming and I fear this is just the beginning. I hope I can go to his funeral. I couldn’t stand the thought of not paying my last respects to him. It literally fees like my dad died or something. I cried more than when my grandpa died and I loved my grandpa dearly. \n\nI'm just so heartbroken.",

      "title": "I think my therapist took advantage of me for 4 years?",
      "body": "Hi everyone, I’m not even sure where to start. There’s so much to unpack, but I’ll do my best. In October of 2019, when I was 23, I decided to try therapy because I had been struggling with anxiety for a long time and finally wanted help. I’m gay and had just entered my first relationship with a woman, so I was also dealing with identity and coming out issues. I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist in my area—let’s call her Sam—and decided to give it a shot.\n\nAt first, everything seemed great. Sam was 31, and shared with me in the first session that she is married to a woman and part of the LGBTQ+ community, which made me feel comfortable opening up. We clicked right away, and over time, I shared more with her about my childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. Then COVID happened, and we shifted to telehealth for a while, but eventually, she suggested we return to in-person sessions because of the intense trauma work we were doing. She said I was the only client she was seeing in person, which made me feel special. We started meeting twice a week, sometimes for up to two hours, often late into the night (this continued for our whole relationship, each session went over and was usually 2 hours or so. Looking back, that was the first red flag, but I didn’t see it at the time.\n\nAs we spent more time together, things started to blur. Our relationship became closer, and she would text me between sessions—sometimes about therapy, but other times just random conversations, sending TikToks, or checking in on me late into the night. Eventually, I started developing feelings for her, which I was upfront about. She explained transference to me, and we spent a lot of time talking about my feelings for her. But I had this gut feeling that she felt something for me too. It wasn’t just the texts—it was the late-night conversations, how much she focused on my sex life, and the way she interacted with me. It almost seemed like she was abusing the transference of that even makes sense?\n\nShe crossed so many boundaries (which I didn’t realize at the time). She sat next to me on the couch during sessions when I told her it was hard for me to talk about trauma while facing her. Eventually, we were hugging after sessions, saying “I love you” to each other, and walking to our cars together. When I cried, she would hold me. She diagnosed me with BPD and told me she also had BPD, saying she “saw herself in me.” I needed a new psychiatrist since mine moved and she got me in with someone amazing who I still see. After setting me up with this psych, Sam told me this is also her psych as well!! Kind of weird no? Anyway this all made me feel so connected to her, and I developed a deep attachment. I became very dependent on her, but looking back, it felt like she encouraged it.\n\nI didn’t know it wasn’t normal. She told me I was her favorite client, called me the most attractive client she ever had, and constantly texted me outside of sessions. At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong it was because I’d never been in therapy before, and all this attention made me feel so special. I even ignored people in my life who said it was unhealthy and that she seemed obsessed with me.\n\nThings continued to escalate. Sam also started seeing my girlfriend, let’s call her Shay, as her therapist. Despite knowing my jealousy and attachment issues, she suggested this, and I agreed, not realizing it was wrong. Looking back on it, it was clear that she enjoyed the jealousy I felt and continued to blur the lines between professional and personal boundaries.\n\nOne of the most distressing parts of therapy was discussing my sexual trauma. I shared with her that sometimes when I talked or thought about it, my body would have these physical reactions, like getting aroused, and it made me feel extremely confused and ashamed. I didn’t understand why it was happening, and it was so embarrassing to admit to her. After I talked about this in session she texted me something that was deeply inappropriate. I added a screenshot of it here.\n\nEventually, I started to question what was happening a bit. While doing my internship, I confided in one of the counselors about my relationship with Sam. I showed him some of our texts, and he was horrified. He told me it was incredibly inappropriate and that I shouldn’t be seeing her anymore. I had never really let myself think about it like that, but hearing someone else confirm it opened my eyes a little.\n\nI ended up journaling about my conversation with the counselor and what he said. I shared that journal entry with Sam before one of our sessions, and she blew up at me. She threatened to cancel our appointment and texted me saying she couldn’t trust me anymore etc. When I went in to see her that night, she was furious. She made me delete all our texts and screenshots in front of her (luckily, I saved some in a private folder). By the end of the session, she was hugging me again, telling me it was okay and that she loved me. It was terrifying.\n\nI’m still processing all of this. She moved earlier this year, and we don’t talk much anymore. She had promised to come to my master’s graduation, but backed out at the last minute, which was devastating. It’s been six months now, and I’ve had a lot of time to think. I realize how inappropriate and abusive this dynamic was. At the time, I thought she was amazing and loved feeling special, but now I see how manipulated and dependent she made me feel. My friends and family have told me I should report her, but I feel so guilty. Was this all my fault? Am I overreacting? I really am looking for some support, and I’m hoping not to get blamed or told I should’ve known better etc. I know this is partially my fault too. But I’m just really confused and hurt.\n\nThere are way more to the whole story but yeah. Sorry for the long post. I’m processing so much:(",

Never.\n\nShe told me that when she was finishing up her PsyD it was a time where she felt very vulnerable. She had to be videotaped doing client interviews and it was a lot of pressure on her.\n\nShe said she started leaving things in her supervisor’s office accidentally. “Accidentally”. She said she was always forgetting her sunglasses, a notebook, a jacket etc.. there, when that wasn’t her typical MO. It just kept happening more and more frequently.\n\nOne day, she found her water bottle with a note from her supervisor taped to it that said, “You still exist to me even when we’re not together.

He’s the only therapist I’ve ever made any kind of progress with and he’s a very handsome man who looks in his early 30s and he’s awesome and one of the only people who I’ve ever made a connection with (I’m autistic so that’s a big deal). If I’m being honest I’ve developed a crush on him that I really hate and I love talking to him and the brief moments he mentions his personal life and learning about him. \n\nPlease, please no judgment from here on out. Please.\n\nFor my appointment yesterday, I really really wanted him to notice me so I spent extra time on my makeup and wore a crop top and some yoga pants leggings with no underwear on under either of them so you could pretty much see the outline of my, well, bits. I guess I was hoping maybe he’d notice my body and would make a move and we’d spend the session…well, you know. Shocker to no one, it didn’t work like that and we just had a session as normal. When I first left I was disappointed but the more I thought about it the more gross I felt. I legitimately started to feel nauseas for a bit as I thought about how I was essentially degrading myself to use my body and get sex from someone I truly respect and think highly of. I am beyond mortified, embarrassed and ashamed that I behaved liked that and now I don’t want to go back and I’ll probably just tell my dad he doesn’t take our insurance anymore. Even worse, I’m scared maybe he knew what I was doing and feels disrespected and weirded out.\n\nSorry, just wanted to tell someone in a safe space. Please, please don’t be cruel.\n\nEDIT: I am honestly blown away and overwhelmed by how kind everyone is.

      "body": "I had a late afternoon therapy session (via Zoom) and my therapist of only a few months hadn't eaten yet so of course I told her it was okay to go ahead and eat something.  Then she asked me if I wanted to talk about a topic I had broached during the previous session.  I really didn't, it was actually the most traumatic event in my life and I wasn't ready, but she was setting out her lunch and not looking at me and I was confused and embarrassed and figured that was what I was supposed to do so I started telling her about it.  Of course I immediately broke down and was distraught and sobbing as I spoke, and at the same time I could hear my therapist crunching on apple slices.  It made me really angry but in my distress and embarrassment I just kept talking.  I wish I had just stopped and told her I would rather postpone my session to another time but I just kept talking, crying, being angry and confused and embarrassed all at the same time, and all while listening to her crunch on her apples.  When I looked up now and then, I would see her stop chewing but I could see a lump in her cheek where her food was sitting while she looked at me \"sympathetically\", obviously waiting for me to look down again so she could finish chewing.  Like an idiot I kept talking.  Later, I was so angry with her and disgusted with myself for not stopping.  I felt like she was not invested in me and my trauma in the least, just \"one more story\" among many others.  I was angry at myself for telling her.  I wanted to take my story back, I felt like it was a betrayal of myself and of the suffering loved one of whom I was speaking.  I was disgusted with myself that I had told a story that had been causing me pain and guilt for 10 years, that I had never told another living sole, to a practical stranger who really didn't care at all.  I don't think I can go back to her.  I guess I was just wondering if I am overreacting.  I did after all tell her it was okay to eat her lunch, and no one was forcing me to continue talking, other than my own insecurity and confusion.  I would love people's input.  Thanks!",

This is also where most new therapists start their careers as we must be supervised for 2 years before practicing independently. Supervision is expensive ($50-150/hour) so working at a larger organization is often the only practical option for a new clinician.  This means there is a good chance the person you're seeing is newer, overwhelmed, and lacking support from those above them in the organization.\n\nWhile this is clearly an unfair system that primarily harms marginalized populations, it is not the fault of the therapist themselves, and we typically have just as much control over the situation as you do. This is likely why you will sometimes see therapists eating something, we literally see 6-8 people in 8 hours. This may also be why your TH seems distracted or typing at times. While I believe it's important to address this directly with people in sessions, where I presently work, we are literally required to do notes during sessions. \n\n**4) Not every therapist will be for you.** \n\nSome of the posts I have read have been extremely critical of the clinician where I could easily see where their actions were valid and appropriate. Some people's methods are outside of the box and sometimes, personalities just don't click.\n\n**5) COVID: THERAPISTS ARE EXHAUSTED. WE ARE TRYING, I SWEAR.** \n\nI have no doubt there are some truly horrible therapists out there. I've even had a couple of my own who really sucked. That being said, most of us got into this field because we want to help. We clawed our way through years of schooling with the end goal of supporting others through challenges. The past 2 years have been redefining for us. How we've been able to continue providing support when so many of us have been facing our own mental health concerns is truly remarkable. Working from home is really hard for a lot of us. The social isolation and things impacting our clients are also impacting us. We really are trying to all hang in together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Feel free to ask questions & I will try my best to respond. \n\nI've been considering writing this for a while, so I hope this is helpful to some of you in your therapy journey!",

      "body": "This is NOT to start any political discourse in the comments.\n\nI am 23f. I was hospitalized frequently as a child with bipolar disorder w/ psychotic symptoms. I have not been hospitalized or in police situations in 6 years. I speak often on trauma from hospitalizations, including police interaction. I was taken down by police, sometimes 7 or 8 of them, as a 70 pound child 10 year old. I had bruises from police restraints before the age of 15. I was once taken to jail during a break prior to being brought to an emergency room. I have had police draw guns on me during mental health episodes before I got my period. I have listened to police tell one another stigmatizing comments related to my situation. These events were horrific, and indisputably traumatizing to me. \n\nIn my personal opinion and research, police are under-trained on mental health situations and tend to escalate episodes out of a genuine lack of knowledge, for both children and adults alike. In the world of mental health, especially with children, police should only be used when there is absolutely no other option. I work hard in several coalitions to advocate for mental health reform in my daily life to prevent the situations that I have gone through. \n\nMy therapist is often swift to tell me that each police situation was for protection, to defend the action taken, and that it should not effect my views of the police. She tells me that they were there to keep me safe, defending every action taken. I do not doubt there were genuine attempts to keep me safe, however, they were not always the appropriate method. I have always been able to justify her response. I either (a) assume that she was not aware of the extent of what I had gone through and broader social contexts relating to police and mental health. or (b) assume that she was using basic cbt principles trying to make me see the possible positive side to everything. \n\nI am her final client of the day every Monday, and she is the final clinician in office. I know which car is hers, as it is the only one there when I leave. The only spot today at the start of session was right behind her. I noticed the sole thin blue line bumper sticker immediately, and it has kind of crushed me. \n\nI know how small and meaningless this should be.\n\nI know that politics should not matter in therapy. I don’t care if she is full-blown Republican, if she can help me. A good therapist won’t let this infiltrate their care. But I cant help but feel her personal political take has impacted her opinions on my own trauma.",

      "body": "I’ve been dealing with PTSD for 5 years and finding it nearly impossible to get adequate care. I have encountered so many self-identified “trauma therapists” who seem like they haven’t even read the DSM entry for PTSD, never mind having the first clue about treating it. I don’t know what people are learning in therapy school these days but there’s a truly astounding amount of underqualified therapists I interview who try to tell me they “understand” or “have experience treating trauma” and then go on to prove they don’t even have a basic understanding of the physiology of PTSD. \n\nGuess what- trauma isn’t a buzzword for your instagram bio. It’s something that drives people to suicide if untreated or mismanaged, and if you take the wrong approach with someone like me, you can do HARM. And I’m saying this from experience of working with therapists who have done actual harm in being inexperienced and yet playing with the fire that is PTSD.\n\nTrauma is complicated. If you have a two-year degree and have been in practice for a year or two with limited evidence-based training in the area: know your limits and check your ego and please ask yourself why you’re calling yourself something you’re not. At the end of the day, are you trying to HELP people or pat yourself on the back and collect a paycheck?\n\nStick to what you know. Be good at what you know. Get training in what you don’t know.

It felt so good to affirm my belief that he was a truly special therapist, and at the same time it hurts even more that he was in so much pain that he took his life when I know he was such an incredibly good and kind person who wanted to help everyone he could.\n\nEveryone who spoke shared about his immense kindness. It was the single reason that the professor who became his graduate supervisor decided to give him an internship even though he wasn't going to take on anyone that summer. He told us a story of when my T was on his way to the office and saw a distressed woman yelling at traffic, so he stopped to ask her if she was okay. He learned that her husband had just died and she couldn't understand how everyone was just carrying on with their lives and going to work like nothing happened. He stayed with her and supported her until help came. Then he went to the office and didn't tell anyone about it until a month later.\n\nHe went to Germany to teach English and came back speaking fluent German. He was incredibly intelligent and very dedicated to learning. He originally had a geology degree and then went back to school to get a bachelor of social work and a masters of social work so he could become a therapist and help others with their trauma. \n\nHe went to an online professional training session with his hedgehog in a pouch around his neck. He loved to help friends in need and he would always drive anyone to the airport of they needed. He even had a fight over driving friends to the airport with a friend he went to school with, and then he later apologized to her say that he realized it meant a lot to her and he wanted to let her drive people there too.\n\nI spoke with his cousin who answered my T's phone when I called because he was late for our session. I got to thank him in person for staying on the phone with me while I processed the news and for sending me information about the memorial and referrals. He thanked me in return. It turns out I was the first person he had to tell over my T's phone and I was somehow helpful to him too.\n\nI thanked his mom for raising such a kind person and told her the immense impact he has had on my life. I think that was one of the hardest parts.\n\nOne of his friends and also a T thanked me for coming and spoke with me for a while, affirming me being there and validating how hard it was as a client.\n\nHis clinical supervisor was very kind and lovely. She reassured me a lot and told me she has my file now and she will keep it safe. She would like to do her best to set me up with another EMDR trained therapist and she will do her best to match me with the best one for me, because that is what my T would have wanted. She reminded me that they wouldn't be the same as my late T though, because he was a unicorn.",

At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better. \n\nI had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. \n\nWhile I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing. \n\nI have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel.  It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle. \n\nTherapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. \n\nSo all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. \n\nTLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.",

She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!\n\nAfter I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nMy boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.\n\nHe set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nFinally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!\n\nIt turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.\n\nSo communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)\n\nTL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!\n\nEDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I’ve never gotten any of that before and now I’m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I’ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)",

      "body": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  \n\n\nSo it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. \n\nI started by saying: \"So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?\"\n\nShe looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. \n\nWhen she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. \n\nShe showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. \n\nI probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. \n\nSo I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:\n\n1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  \n2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an \"issue\" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   \n3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. \n\nAnd you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.\n\nTalking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. \n\nI have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.\n\nShe has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.\n\nShe hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.\n\nIt's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.\n\nThe main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. \n\nIf I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. \n\nI also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. \n\nI had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. \n\nThank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.\n\nAlso thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.\n\nI have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.\n\nEdit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:\nNonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg\nWhen I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith\nWhy Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov",

He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute) \n\nHe opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.\n\nWe went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said “I wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment” then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke 😂\n\nAfter we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home) \n\nYesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!❤️\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much 😊\n\nTL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home😂 I'm overjoyed right now!",

      "body": "Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/\n\nThank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.\n\nA few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.\n\nMy husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nWhich is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.\n\nWe used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.\n\nI started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.\n\nI guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. \n\nAs for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.\n\nTL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.",

      "body": "So many through comments and PMs requested an update from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vlueu/i_29f_am_traveling_overseas_to_meet_my_online/) and so I thought I'd do one!\n\nAfter my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call. \n\nI went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;\n\nI learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This \"relationship\" was my first \"serious\" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely. \n\nMy first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!\n\nTLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever. Glad I cancelled the bf and not the trip.",

So here's an update:\n\nAfter I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.\n\nWe pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, \"deluding herself into thinking she's actually home\", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).\n\nSome things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.\n\nWe ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.\n\nThank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of *someone* in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.\n\ntl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid.

      "body": "I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.\n\nI felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.\n\nWell, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D\n\nWhat happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!\n\nAnd so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.\n\nThings started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.\n\nAt a low point, I said to my husband: \"You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring.\" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.\n\nOver the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.\n\nOne night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.\n\nI got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.\n\nDo you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!\n\nOur sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!\n\nEven though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3\n\nThank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.\n\nTLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex. I went to a counsellor. I stopped self-loathing. Husband and I fell back in love again & have great sex.\n\nUpdate: OMG thank you thank you thank you for all the comments and awards! I have no words! I thought maybe 5 people would care about the update, not this amazing amount of encouragement! Thank you so much, so glad to have been on this journey with you. <3",

Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!\n\nAfter I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.\n\nI went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.\n\nBut then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to \"command\" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.\n\nYou guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.\n\nOverall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!\n\nTLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!",

That's not cool.\n\nI gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.\n\nNoah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P\n\nOne of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.\n\nAbout a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.\n\nThat was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.\n\nI'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.\n\nIt sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.\n\nTL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.\n\nThanks again for the help!",

      "body": "[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nStraight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. \n\nThe last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. \n\nI just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. \n\nSo, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you! \n\nTLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years.",

      "title": "[UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.",
      "body": "[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)\n\nI know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).\n\nThrough interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  \n\n1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.\n\n2.  He see someone psychologically.\n\n3.  Couple's counseling.\n\nI decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.\n\nHe took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  \n\nAnd then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.\n\nA few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.\n\nI headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.\n\nI drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  \n\nShe left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.\n\nSo I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.\n\nI worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.\n\nMore recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.\n\nOn the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.\n\nI started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.\n\nSo I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).\n\nI decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.\n\nI had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.\n\nSo when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.\n\nBut nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt \"forced\" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.\n\nHe then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  \n\nI think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  \n\nI should have listened to my gut all along.\n\nWe had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    \n\nI don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.\n\nOverall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.\n\nAnd thank you everyone for all your help.\n\ntl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.",

It was such a huge relief. \n\nHe asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. \n\nWhen I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. \n\nWe talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. \n\n Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.\n\nTL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me.

I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.\n\n\n\nFor a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.\n\n\n\nThings got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.\n\n\n\nWhile I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. \n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.\n\n\n\n\nAs of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.",

I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding. \n\nWell, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates. \n\nThe first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't. \n\nI later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything. \n\nWell he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, \"Are you going to marry me or not?\" And I said of course.

I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn’t want to be with me because she doesn’t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it’s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn’t decide and said to give her the weekend. \n\nThis morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that. \n\nIt was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped. \n\nI came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don’t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I’m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me. \n\nSo I’m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I’m moving forward and trying to be positive.

      "title": "UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.",
      "body": "Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts\n\nAgain, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.\n\nSo, husband cheated. He has been since \"maybe two weeks before last Christmas\", according to him.\n\nI was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his \"best friend\" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. \n\nHe said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're \"best friends\" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of \"inspirational\" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.\n\nFirst, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.\n\nHe answered with, \"Not on purpose\". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.\n\nI asked what \"Not on purpose\" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, \"I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.\"\n\nNow. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).\n\nThis moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.\n\nHe finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. \n\nThen it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.\n\nThis is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.\n\nMy uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. \n\nI'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.\n\nA few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.\n\nThere were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.\n\nHere's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.\n\n**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!\n\n**Edit:** Formatting\n\n**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. \n\nLove to you all.\n\n\n**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. \n\nI will leave you with this:\n\nMy dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.\n\nThen he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.\n\nJust thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to \"be terrifying\" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.\n\nThis is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to \"be terrifying\". :)\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.\n\nLove,\n\n-T",

The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.\n\nI moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.\n\n**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**\n\nI told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.\n\nI'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.\n\nI met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.\n\n**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**\n\nIt gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.\n\nBut I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.\n\ntl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.\n\nEDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year. \n\nIf you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again. Both loving yourself and having someone else love you 💕",

      "body": "OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\\_30f\\_want\\_to\\_discuss\\_moving\\_in\\_with\\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)\n\nThanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.\n\nAs mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, \"Well did you want to? My lease is up in July.\" and he said that he did.\n\nIt was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.\n\nWe ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!\n\nHe keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)\n\n**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!\n\n**Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.\n\nMany people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)",

      "title": "My husband is reluctant to be intimate with me after I was in a major accident",
      "body": "I (30f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 5 years and together for 8. Obviously we have an age gap in our relationship and whenever we discussed possible health issues or medical care, it was regarding him. \n\nAbout four months ago, I was in a car accident. I was talking on Bluetooth to my husband because I was nervous driving on the icy roads going to our house, when another car rounded a corner too fast and lost control. It was one of those “exact wrong moment” things and my car went off the road and into a tree. My husband heard the whole thing and my last memory before I lost consciousness was him screaming my name. \n\nI don’t want to get into the bloody details, but I ended up being in the hospital for over a month. I needed multiple surgeries and have been in physical therapy ever since. I am finally getting to a point where I feel like myself again and am no longer in pain. I’ve gained back some weight and look good if I do say so myself. \n\nMy husband literally worked out of my hospital room for the entire time I was there. He went home to shower, sleep and look after the dogs, then came right back. He attended all my therapy appointments so he would know how to better help me recover at home. He was amazing and everything I could ask him to be in that kind of horrible situation. I love him so much and so yesterday while shopping, I saw this gorgeous black lingerie set and decided to surprise him. We haven’t had sex since before the accident and every time I try, it feels like he makes an excuse or expresses some concern about some random body part of mine that is no longer injured. \n\nHe was on his laptop in bed when I came in wearing my new purchases and I could tell he was taken by surprise. I basically crawled into his lap and started kissing his neck and grinding on him. He was definitely hard but then he lost it and pushed me away, saying that we shouldn’t rush this and he doesn’t want to jeopardize my recovery with sex. I was crying by the time he ended the sentence and said “I’m fine! The doctors say sex is fine!” But he was already walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. \n\nI don’t know what to think. Is it the scars? Is the memory of me in a hospital bed unable to even sit up by myself repelling him? I finally am starting to feel good about myself and my body again and the fact that he won’t touch me is really hurting my mental health. It’s probably a long shot but has anyone else experienced this?\n\nTL;DR: I was in a major car accident and I’m finally back to myself but my husband doesn’t want to have sex with me.\n\nUpdate: \n\nThank you again for everyone’s kind and thoughtful comments, I read all of them even if I didn’t respond. Last night when we got in bed I curled up next to my husband and held him while I said basically “we’ve been through a lot, would you be willing to get therapy with me to make sure everything is alright for both of us? I love you so much and I don’t want any underlying trauma to effect our relationship.”\n\nHe was silent for about ten second and then the floodgates opened. I’ve only seen him cry once or twice in our entire relationship (at our wedding and the first time I told him I loved him), but I held him while he sobbed for what was probably an hour. He kept apologizing for it and I had to keep saying “don’t be sorry, I’m here, cry if you need to cry.” And I shed some tears of my own. \n\nIt was an exhausting but ultimately extremely cathartic experience. When it was all over and he was able to say more than a few words, he told me that there was about 15 minutes when he was sure he had just heard the love of his life die, then we got to the hospital and the doctors made it clear they would do everything they could but the extent of my injuries were extreme and severe. Then he spent hours calling family members, waiting, pacing and trying to grapple with the fact that I might die and he might be alone. Then I spent five days in the ICU, mostly unconscious. He said he’s never known fear like that in his life. \n\nIn the end we agreed to go to individual and couple’s therapy and even touched on the sex thing, wherein he admitted that he knows objectively nothing bad will happen to me if we have sex but for some reason it is sparking this protective instinct that makes him want to treat me like glass. \n\nSo we’re working on it, and our marriage is amazing. He’s the love of my life and we can get through this.",

      "body": "[My first post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ecgbv/i_30_f_am_sitting_in_the_back_of_my_rv_as_my/) The TLDR of the first post is that I bought an RV with my money so I could write/travel in it while husband is away for business. Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn't want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life.\n\nI promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be.\n\nWhen I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver's seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me.\n\nTim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I'm not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: \"I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!\" \n\nI was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother's house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence.\n\nWe made it to his mom's house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, \"I'm not sure myself. I'm waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex.\"\n\nTim's mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim's mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.\n\nTim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn't apologize at his mother's house, why he didn't say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn't care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven't heard anything since. \n\nI have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process. \n   \n**tl;dr**: Husband thought he could get away with cheating on me by using my RV. I found his emails, packed his bags, and left him at his mom's house. His mom took my side and has ripped into him since. I got a lawyer and have filed for divorce.",

A lot of you asked when after my housemates confession he told me about it: he  told me a couple of hours afterwards. He explained to me after we had a chat about it that he was afraid I wouldn't believe him or be angry, because at first he'd thought it was a weird joke that made him uncomfortable, and he felt (rightly so) weirded out. I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you. It's not easy, and you can quickly find yourself unsure if those brief moments of crossing a line happened. He's not on our lease, and understandably he was concerned about me and the power dynamic in the house (bc her room is a mini granny flat, she pays the bigger share).\n\nI also don't believe that it was, as some suggested, a hypomanic episode. I have BP2 and while I understand the 'love rush', she exhibited zero other behaviours, and never tried to contact my BF outside of the weird touching. I also can appreciate there's no way she was actually in 'love'.\n\nSO:\n\nYesterday, after a tense few days of trying to avoid her, my BF and I were in the kitchen at breakfast, with her around in the living area. I went to 'our' bathroom (she has an en suite) which is just off the main area to brush my teeth. I walked back out to grab my phone as she was sidling behind my boyfriend who was looking in the fridge, and caught her *running her hand and forearm across his lower back where his tee shirt had ridden up a little*. My boyfriend, who didn't see me, yelped really loudly and just lost it. He yelled at her to \"stop!\" and when they both saw me he starts going \"you see?! You see?! This is what I was talking about!\"\n\nI was furious, just whole body anger, and I could see she had now realised he HAD told me about her confession/behaviour, and just sprinted to her room and slammed the door. My BF and I went out for a walk to calm down, and he kept apologising for not being \"more firm\", but he was shaken up - some of you told me I should just confront her head on, which in the moment I 100% sided with, I was so angry for him. He told me he'd rather give her the opportunity to do it diplomatically. I appreciated what you guys said about lock down being extenuating, and in discussion with our mutual friend, I was willing to believe that an element of it was naivete, and a bit of fantasy gone too far. I was willing to be kind to her.\n\nWhen we returned with a plan of action, we knocked on her door but she didn't answer. We tried a couple of times but she wouldn't come out, although she was 'seeing' my Whatsapp messages. Come late afternoon, I was just over it, so I knocked, and told her I was coming in. I sat her down on her bed and told her gently but firmly it was inappopriate, making us uncomfortable, told her she had to get the hell over it/herself if she intended to continue to live with us. She burst into tears and starts crying about how she's \"so sorry\" and what a \"bad person' she is, and she can't believe the pressure of lockdown is getting to her, whatever, and I felt bad. Started sympathising, trying to be compassionate...and then she says \"It's just so unfair that the guy I'm in love with has a really great girlfriend\".\n\nReader, I lost my shit. Unfair, *my ass.* I told her she had a lot of growing up to do, and perspective to learn, and that she owed the house an apology. She started to have a meltdown, a full, weeping, hiccuping snotty meltdown. *AND THEN*  when I stood up to leave, I spotted, in her clothes rack, my freaking shirt. I took it, and went back to my room.\n\nMy housemate cried loudy with the door OPEN until 7PM (for....attention???) when I cracked. I used our emergency contact sheet, called her mum, told her she had to come pick up my housemate. I've never met this woman who came rushing in like a superstar, but the look of annoyance and embrassament on her face when she arrived and found her 27 y/o daughter having a tantrum told me this wasn't a new part of her personality. My housemate also STFU pretty quickly after she realised her mum was there. They didn't say anything to us, and we just hid in our room until they were gone. I think she'll be gone at least for a while, but I texted her to let her know it would be best if she texted me before she came back. IDK when I'll see her. Technically the lease ends in August so my BF and I think we can make it work and find someone new, and if not, it's not so long til we can resign without her.\n\nAs a coda to all this?? My BF mentioned if she took a blouse, maybe she took other stuff too. I appreciate some of you may consider this an invasion of privacy, but I did go back in, just to check the clothes rack. I found: a set of my jeans, my tee shirt, one of my boyfriends work shirts, a vinyl I owned, my fucking charm bracelet from when I was a KID from inside my jewellery box, and a sheet of my old antidepressants...this was just what was on the rack/on display. I imagine there's more in the drawers. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I left them there for now bc I don't want there to be any 'doubt' she stole them.  There's zero chance she's going to live here any more. Honestly, I hope she does get help. I'm really angry and violated, as is my BF, but I can empathise with the havoc an uncontrolled mental health issue can wreak on your behviour, and while it's still wrong, it still sucks for her to experience it and lose friends. NOTE: *I can't be sure, none of us can! But I feel like maybe (?) she has a histrionic personality disorder.*\n\nTL;DR: my relatively normal housemate who told my BF she was in love with him turned out to also be a thief. Yikes!!\n\nPS! Our mutual friend has told me another friend who went to school with my housemate had told her a rumour she'd told a bunch of people in their year that she had leukemia. YIKES.\n\n(edited for typo)",

      "body": "[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cjph9/how_do_i_26f_tell_my_husband_31m_im_addicted_to/)\n\nI've been sober since May 22, 2017 :)\n\nIt's been almost a year and a half since I posted, I was a mess that day and really overwhelmed. You all gave me the push I needed to gather my courage and tell my husband about my drug use, **thank you so much for that**. I mean it, I knew he needed to know but I couldn't make myself follow through until I received encouragement a bunch of internet strangers. I hate to think what might have happened had I continued hiding it from him.\n\nMy husband has been supportive, compassionate, and kind throughout my recovery. I wouldn't be doing so well today without him, there aren't words to express how much I love him and how grateful I am to be married to such a good man. With the help of my therapist I was able to open up to him about being raped (it was a violent, ugly, all around horrible incident) and the effect PTSD has had on me (it's an explanation, not an excuse, for the drug use). \n\nWe've had to work on rebuilding trust and I realize that's going to take time. He still prefers I stay home most of the time and he has reservations about new friends- both are totally reasonable in my opinion. I understand his feelings completely. We do more together now and I feel more included in his life, which has really helped my mental health. Every day I do my best to prove my love, appreciation, and respect for him. We're both continually putting effort into ourselves and our marriage.\n\nAs for my recovery, I honestly feel a little weird calling it that. I didn't use long term and didn't face many of the same challenges as other addicts. But I am an addict, I'm always aware of that and I realize I'm no different fundamentally from someone doing heroin on the streets.\n\nDrugs were a distraction and a way to escape bad memories and nightmares. They were also part of my social life as my only friend in the area (at that time) used them too. Once I accepted that I had, and will always have, PTSD and began getting proper treatment I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I'm extremely lucky and thankful I stopped when I did.\n\nDealing with my mental health hasn't been easy. Last August I went to a behavioral health hospital for six days. I didn't want to go at first but my husband and therapist convinced me I needed to- they were right. I felt much better afterward and I met a few people like me while I was there, it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. People can say that you aren't alone all the time but it's different when you actually experience it.\n\nMy husband and I went to couples' therapy for 3 months. It helped us quite a bit, we realized we needed to talk about things that hadn't occurred to either of us before sitting down with a therapist. It helped me understand his feelings and how my drug use (and concealing it from him) affected him. It helped him understand why I did what I did. It gave us a safe place to talk and that eventually led to better communication in private.\n\nI'm still seeing a therapist twice a month and attend group therapy once a month. I'm stable, healthy, and happy. I love my life and I'm really excited about the future. We're expecting a baby in the Spring and I can't wait to be a mom. I'm so looking forward to raising a family with my husband. Life is good. :) Thanks again, /r/relationships \n\n**TL;DR**: I've been sober since May 22, 2017. My husband and I are doing well, we're happy and very much in love. He's supported me and loved me through this process. We've had a few struggles along the way but we work through things as they come up and move forward. I'm continuing to receive treatment for my mental health and I feel stronger than I ever have. I've learned I can't hide from my problems and now that I've received the appropriate treatment for PTSD I don't want to hide from it anymore. I'm finally happy and excited about my life and my future.",

      "title": "UPDATE: My fiancee (24F) has no bridesmaids and it's making her so upset she wants to call off the wedding. How can I (25m) help?",
      "body": "OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3am0dc/my_fianc%C3%A9e_24f_has_no_bridesmaids_and_its_making/?sort=new\n\nDid not expect to update this fast.  Did not expect to update at all, unless something miraculous happened.  And it did.\n\nIn short, I have the best friends in the world.\n\nI read through a ton of these comments, but not all (over 1000?!)  and decided to look for my fiance's box of wedding planning stuff, because I had a suspicion.  Inside the box was all these magazine clippings of a big church wedding, flower ideas and stuff.  And then I saw pictures of the dresses.  They were all big, poofy ornate things that don't seem akin to my fiancee's style at all.  But...they're similar to the dresses my sisters wore at their weddings.\n\nIt all sort of clicked for me.  My fiancee probably doesn't want a church wedding or any of these fancy trimmings, she's trying to win my family's favor.  The hell.  I really should've noticed this earlier and gotten more involved, I know.\n\nMy fiancee flew home on Thursday to spend a few days with her dad (Father's Day weekend and all).  I couldn't go because of work, so I was alone until this morning.  So, real late at night, I called up my buddy Ravi (26M).  Ravi's my best man, we've known each other since we were kids, split up when we went off to college, and reconnected three years ago.  We moved to SC so I could join the company he works for. \n\nI just opened up to Ravi.  It was really late but he listened to me anyway, about my worries about my fiancee.  He said that it was very likely that she was trying to curry favor with my family, but she probably wasn't going to admit to it easily.  He said he'd talk to her.\n\nI told him that he barely knows her.  He said not to worry, and that he'd be around tomorrow evening.\n\nMy fiancee came home happy (she always is after seeing her dad) this morning.  I went off to work without asking about the wedding, and she set to work on her writing (she's off for the summer).  I got home early and at like 5 PM Ravi came to my house with my other good friends: Carson, Andrew, and Tim (23-30M).  I know all these guys from various places and we're all a solid group.  Still, this was unexpected.\n\nRavi came up to my fiancee and said that the guys were taking her wedding dress shopping.\n\nWe were both freaked out as hell.  I had no idea this was coming, and my fiancee looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  She whispered to me \"they won't like me\", and I urged her to just go for it.  Ravi reminded her that he has sisters, Carson's been divorced, and Andrew's had his fair share of girlfriends, so they know dresses.  Plus, he has a lady friend that works at a small boutique, where they'd try first.\n\nShe still didn't want to go, and then he said something like \"hey, you're marrying our best friend, don't you think we should get to know you and make sure you're not a ghost or something?\"  (He's not great with tact).  But she chuckled a little at that and gave in.\n\nThey were gone for a while and came back an hour ago.  They didn't find a dress, but they looked around the stores for a while and fiancee found a style she liked (not the poofy ball gown style).  They also went out for ice cream and when they walked in the door, she was joking and laughing with them all.  I hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.  It was amazing.\n\nThen we all sat down together and Ravi asked her to talk to me about what's on her mind.\n\nI still don't know how they got her to open up.  She whispered that she didn't really want the big church wedding, that she wanted to wait a little while and plan a small ceremony for just the people we really care about.  I was all for it, I told her not to worry about bridesmaids or anything, it could just be us.  She said no, she wants her dad, the guys, and my family to be there.  \n\nAndrew, a kickass guitar player, said he'd put together a band for us.  He asked my fiancee what her favorite song is, he'd figure out an arrangement.  This is the kind of question she usually dodges, but she blushed a little and actually told the truth.  (Panama by Van Halen if anyone cares; girl knows how to rock out).  This was the real sign that she's starting to trust them.  I don't think anyone knows her favorite song except me and her dad (who bought her Van Halen CD's growing up)\n\nI told her I'd call my family and tell them the church wedding's off.  If they make a big stink about it, I don't fucking care.  I have my bros and my beautiful future bride.  That's all the family I need.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Church wedding's off, my friends are awesome, future looks bright so far.",

The entire time he was begging for another chance and promising “this time would be different” (eye-roll) he was still sleeping with the affair partner and telling him he loved her and would do anything to make it work with her. It didn’t even hurt me to find it out. I was THAT unsurprised. It just helped me stop feeling guilty. I divorced his ass. \n\n I thank the universe every day that he is no longer connected to me in a romantic way. It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nShortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy. \n\nTo anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a “broken family”- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden. \n\nTL;DR: I divorced him and found true happiness.",

After posting it, I read my own words and realized that the relationship was over. I was making excuses for him and justifying staying miserable in the relationship because I just loved him so much. \n\nWe had a talk when I visited my hometown and broke up. We both were emotional but knew it was  for the best, and I was content thinking we were going to spend time being single and discovering who we are as individuals after being so close for so long. \n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the case. I found out he had been cheating for at least a couple months before telling me he wanted another break. He began officially dating the new girl about 3 days after we broke up and he moved in with her after a couple months of dating. He has always been super resistant to commitments before, so that came as a shock. My self esteem took a huge hit. \n\nNow things are different. I discover new things about myself every day, I spend time with my friends who make me feel loved and important, and I’m truly happy for the first time in a long time. At first I wanted to start dating again and I told myself I was ready, but the truth is that there’s so much I don’t know about myself yet, and I want to get to know me before I focus on another relationship. \n\nAnyway, thank you to the people who commented and let me know that something was going on. As obvious as it was to them, I was completely blindsided. I’m just grateful to be out of that situation and I’m excited for what’s ahead.\n\nTl;dr : we broke up, he was cheating, I’m much better now",

I texted BF, telling him essentially that I needed a bit of space to take a breather and reevaluate. I made it clear that I didn’t want to break up, but felt like I was always being monitored and I wanted to make a game plan to have healthy communication through this pandemic. \n\nHe called me super upset and accused me of choosing SB over him. I told him that it wasn’t about SB, it’s not like I chose SB, he’s literally just someone I get along with who I can hang out with during the pandemic. I explained to him that it was not like I was spending every waking moment with him, I do my homework in the morning, we hang out in the afternoon, and my evening time is divided between the 4 of us (mom, stepdad, SB) and FaceTiming BF. \n\nBF then accused me of doing special, “boyfriend” activities with SB. He told me that it was always his dream to teach me to drive (he doesn’t even have his permit. Am I supposed to wait around for him to get it?). Also apparently me teaching SB how to bake bread? Which is stupid because I was going to make the bread to begin with, and SB “helped” by moving the heavy mixer, eating half the almond slices, and taking pictures for Instagram. \n\nHe also screamed at me for not moving in, saying how all this would have been prevented if we were living together. I told him that I have no interest in living somewhere that I’m not allowed to be. I can’t afford a fine from bylaw, and if I were to get kicked out, it would be more difficult to find my way home since I don’t drive. \n\nIn the end, I told BF that I would not give up my relationship with SB, who is part of my family and a genuinely nice guy, to ease my BFs insecurities and cater to his demands. I told BF that I needed time to cool down, and that I’d talk to him in a few days. That was all on Friday, and today I reached out to see how he was. He was still pissed at me and accusatory, so I basically told him that this wasn’t working and I want to break up. I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn’t deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family. \n\nAnyway thanks to everyone who commented. I’m really sad this is the outcome and I’ve been crying a lot, but I’m also kind of relieved. \n\nTLDR: we broke up because he couldn’t see how controlling he was being.",

First of all, I want to say I was absolutely blown away by the outpouring of love and support I received on my first post. I never could have imagined it would blow up like that and I received so many thoughtful and kind comments and messages from strangers. \n\nThat being said, when I wrote that, I was in a weird place. Physically I had mostly healed but I was determined to shove down any emotional trauma because I was so exhausted from the previous months of work trying to heal my body. I wanted to be alright, and I wanted my marriage to be the same as it was before the accident. \n\nMy husband and I just attended our third marriage counseling appointment and I’m very happy to report the exercises and worksheets we’ve been given are helping rebuild the husband/wife relationship instead of the caregiver/patient relationship which has been present for the last 5 months. My husband just had his first individual therapy appointment a few days ago and I have mine next week. In short, we’re putting in the work. \n\nWe’re also having sex again! Like, *a lot* of sex! I feel silly bragging about that to the internet at large, but it makes me so happy that we’ve figured out that part of all this. Prior to the accident and really throughout our whole relationship we’ve been so ridiculously into each other, it was rare we even skipped a day. I missed having that connection to him and he was clearly hurting too. \n\nAnyway. I just thought everyone deserved an update ♥️♥️♥️♥️\n\n\nTL:Dr- we’re getting better!",

I asked Reddit if I should leave by July 1, and it was unanimous that I absolutely should.\n\nI didn’t leave July 1.\n\nI left the night of June 30.\n\nThe cleaning didn’t get done, surprising literally no one. We were driving to our apartment and I told her that I was really crestfallen about July 1.\n\n“Why? Is that a bad date for you or something?”\n\nI was furious, but kept it to myself. I told her how I felt, and I reminded her of my deadline. I told her that I was moving out and that I was done.\n\nShe cried and cried and cried, and begged for a week to clean the apartment to “show that she was committed to this marriage”. I said that she was free to do it, but I wasn’t going to sleep there during that, and I moved in with my friend. We agreed to reassess the condition of the apartment Sunday morning. \n\nShe told me how spiritually edifying it was to clean. I was really optimistic for a bit. \n\nWednesday comes and my FIL calls me, frantic. He’s like a dad to me. He tells me that my wife emailed him (which she never talks to him unless she has to), and I asked why. He told me that she begged him to tell me to ‘come back home’. He remarked that it was bizarre, but I was incensed. “No, FIL, it’s not bizarre, it’s shitty. She’s trying to leverage you though our relationship to get me back.”\n\nSaturday comes and she sends me a message on Facebook saying “you know, it doesn’t look as good as I wanted it to physically, but I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress emotionally and *isn’t that what matters?*”\n\nI told her that such progress would have been appreciated two years ago, but I had to walk- I couldn’t do it any more.\n\nShe spent money online with our card without informing me on yarn and we had a disagreement about it. I told her that I wanted the bank account closed, but she “couldn’t bear to see me in person”. I redirected my checks to a new account instead.\n\nIt had been weeks and I finally went back to get my things and it got a lot worse. There was a water leak in the carpet, the litter boxes weren’t taken care of since I took care of them the day I left, and she managed to move the microwave into her bedroom. The latter was particularly surprising because she refused to move anything heavier than 10 lbs because of a cited rotator cuff injury for years and yet got a 40 lbs microwave into her room.\n\nI reported the conditions to my MIL, who co-signed the lease with us. She called me back to bemoan “what am I going to do about my daughter? You don’t understand how hard it is to have to think about how to take care of her!”\n\nI snapped at MIL about her nonsense. She asked me what she should do about my ex-wife, feeding her histrionic personality. I told her that I had no idea, but she signed papers 27 years ago that made it her responsibility and not mine.\n\nI’m happily living with my friend. Her and I are currently figuring out what we are, but we’re being supportive of each other and making each other lives easier. We both just celebrated birthdays (happy quarter-century!) and that was perfect. \n\nI’ve been told that my ex-wife has had a much more rigid and stoic affect since I left. MIL told me that she didn’t even say she missed me. “It’d be nice if she came back.”\n\nI heard from FIL that they’re mad that the car I have is in my name; it was given to me as a graduation present, and was an old family car.\n\nI start my new job tomorrow. I’ve been getting ready all last week and I am so nervous but so excited.\n\nI’m really glad I left.\n\nTL;DR: My wife begged me for her last second chance, still didn’t do anything. Tried to get her dad to bend my arm to come back. She wrecked the apartment even more since I left, so I notified MIL. MIL is more concerned about herself than her daughter. I’m happy with my friend and I start my big girl job tomorrow, and thank God.\n\nEDIT: I made this clarification in the comments, but it needs to be said- I was estranged from my friend when I got with my wife. I was disowned for being gay by my family and had to immediately leave college and sought refuge with my ex-wife, and my friend and I fell out of contact. We got into contact again this year when I was interviewing for jobs in the area where she lived, not knowing that she was there. I’m trying to figure out how we’re going to be roommates in the long-term, and for how long, etc. Logistics.",

      "title": "UPDATE to “I'm unhappy with how my (24 F) boyfriend (26M) treats me, but he won't listen to me for long enough for me to get my point across”",
      "body": "Here is the original post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/grls25/comment/fs2iubn?context=3)\n\nTldr: confronted my bofriend about how he treats me after asking for advice on reddit. He cried and talked about his issues, we broke up. I'm much better for it. \n\nFirstly, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. I got so much from it, and seeing so many supportive comments really helped me. I learned a lot, so thank you all so much. I realised through reading your comments that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It wasn't communication tips I needed, I needed to get out. \n\nThe past month has been so up and down but I wanted to share an update. After a pretty weird “stepping on eggshells” kind of morning, I confronted him about his behaviour and mood swings. I prepped myself for a huge argument and honestly it didn’t go exactly as I expected. First of all he started to deny he was doing anything wrong, but for once I stood my ground. I don’t think he was expecting that. I had lots to say (many of your comments came in useful there), and I tried so hard not to back down. \n\nAfter a while he kind of… changed. He got upset. He then started saying all sorts of things, that he was sorry but he didn’t realise how his behaviour affected me (though I’d brought it up many times). A little later on he said that he had been thinking for a few months that it was his fault my doctor said I had depression. So that’s a huge contradiction?? He said that for a few weeks he had been thinking about breaking up with me “because it’s my fault that you are this way and breaking up sooner would have been the noble thing to do”, but that he was so torn for ages. He said that’s why he had been even more awful to me lately, that his frustrations were just coming out. Again, contradicting what’s he said about not realising how his behaviour affected me. He said he has never cheated but I’m really not sure if I believe that. Maybe it’s best if I don’t know.\n\nThen something really unexpected happened, he started to cry, the first time I have ever seen him cry. He told me that he had been texting a work friend over the past few days about our relationship. He even showed me a message she sent to him which went something like this: “you have a wonderful, textbook girlfriend and you are fucking it up because you are being an ass. This is why everyone at work thinks you’re a psychopath. You are so cold and bad when it comes to feelings”. So I guess it wasn’t just me who found his behaviour not normal??\n\nHe cried even more and said that he doesn’t feel close to people, that there’s only a handful of people he lets in and he doesn’t know why he does that. He said that even being around his immediate family was cold and formal and he doesn’t know why he is like that and can’t connect with people, and that’s also why he throws himself into work so much. I told him that if he didn’t get help, he would end up a very lonely old man. In that moment I felt pretty strong and proud of myself.\n\nSo as you may have guessed, we broke up. Part of me for a while even thought about trying to save it and work at it, and now that I look back I can’t believe I was ever even thinking that. He kept saying “I just don’t know what to do for the best, should we break up or not?” But doing so was absolutely the right thing. I’ve since had many friends coming forward saying they didn’t trust him, something was off etc.\n\nRegarding the girl I talked about, his ex who he cheated on his other ex with- I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was “he’s thinking about my sister ;)” to which he replied with another winky face so… what does that say. But I’m not looking Instagram at this stuff anymore. On the day we broke up he packed some bags and left, he told me to stay with a friend. It turns out that that friend was his exes brother, and he’s been living there for a month. I will be moving into a new place in 2 weeks and even though he has gone to stay with his friend he is still paying his share of the rent, he just swings by to pick up some stuff every now and then when I’m at work, I haven't actually seen him.\n\nFor the past few months I’ve been feeling really low, with barely any energy. I’m picking myself back up again and though it’s a slow process, I’m coming back into myself. I’m determined that I’m not going to let anyone make me feel like that again.\n\nI’m not sure if I needed to write all of that and if you guys needed all of those details, but writing this was quite cathartic. I guess I would just say, to anyone who is reading this and my original post, who is in a relationship that they feel horrible in, just leave. It’s hard, but please leave. You will feel SO much better.\n\nThanks again, Reddit.",

      "body": "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how\\_do\\_i\\_26f\\_talk\\_to\\_my\\_so21m\\_about\\_needing\\_him/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how_do_i_26f_talk_to_my_so21m_about_needing_him/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought I would update on what’s happened since my post one year ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShortly after, I chose an appropriate time to talk to R about the situation. I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It’s when leaving the house and I’m not late for any commitments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn’t to be just mine but mine and R’s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn’t feel like he needed to live alone to “discover himself”. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**( edit:** this note now hangs in our bedroom wall as a sign of how we dreamed this house, planned it and accomplished it together. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent. We went to see it and R loved it as much as me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the last 5 months he has surprised me everyday. He has taken this flat and looked after it in a responsible adult way. R has been busy fixing everything that needed TLC in the house, spent time decorating the bedroom, he even started to cook and now makes delicious meals. His parents visit often and are super proud of him too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for your advice.\n\nSpecial shoutout to /u/baffled_soap for [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how_do_i_26f_talk_to_my_so21m_about_needing_him/dzk3jod?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) It made me realise that maintaining a living space is a life skill anyone can learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit 2:** thank you everyone for all your kind words. I plan to show this post to R when he gets home from work. I should probably add that when friends ask us how living together it's going he says he's the clean one. Cheeky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: we talked, R respected my space, 5 months after the post we moved in, having the best time in our little beautiful flat.",

      "title": "UPDATE: girl (20s F) in my DND group post (20s M)",
      "body": "Hi everyone, so a few days ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xoy6k/this_girl_early_20sf_in_is_tearing_our_dnd_group/?sort=confidence) about this girl (Sam) in my DND group who everyone has a crush on, and how it's causing a lot of my friends to turn on me cuz they think she has a crush on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I wanted to thank everyone for all the great advice I got, and it led me to take some action over the weekend. So on Sunday (yesterday), I was txting with Sam and I decided to bring up and ask her how she was feeling about our gaming group. She confessed to me that she's been feeling really stressed out lately because she feels that Jake and Dave (our DM) have really been ostracizing her, because she's been getting closer to me. She told me that Dave would send her private angry or rude messages, saying mean things about me to her behind my back. I was shocked and honestly kind of defeated to hear how these guys who I thought were my friends treated me behind my back. She said she was so cut up about this and that she didn't want to come to DND anymore because she didn't feel like it's any fun anymore, and that hurt me the most, having her lose something she loves because of some dumb guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, based on the advice I got here on my last post, I did two things after getting this knowledge. I called up Dave, and told him that he either needs to grow up, and treat her with the respect she deserves, or she will leave the group. He was backpedaling, but eventually came clean that he has a thing for her as well and was just jealous of the attention I was receiving from her. He said that it's not her fault and it's not my fault and it's just something he needs to work through on his own, so at least he was able to be cognizant of that. The second thing I did was talk to Sam frankly about us and our relationship. I told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she liked me as well, which she said she really did, and had for a while now (which made my heart want to explode out of my chest). I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, even with all this drama going on, and I told her that I was on her side and would support her whatever she wanted to do with our gaming group. In the end, we've decided that we are dating now and we'll both be taking a break from DND for a few sessions before we go back and tell everyone. I am just so happy to have her in my life, and if my friends can't get over the fact that we're dating, she and I will start a new DND group with people who can be adults about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thank you all for your help, and I'm glad I bit the bullet, I couldn't be happier right now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: I asked the girl out, she said yes we're dating now :) I called out our DM on his BS and he apologized and said he would cut it out. Looking forward to brighter DND days with my girlfriend!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: 1.2K?? I never expected this to blow up so much! Thank you again, everyone, for your kind words, thoughts, anecdotes, and advice. I've talked to Dave again today actually and told him that Sam and I were officially together and we want to be able to come back and play all together again, but my respect for Sam's feelings overcomes my want to continue playing with them. Dave told me that he was really sorry for being such an ass before and that he is happy for Sam and I and doesn't want this to come between our friendship. I am hopeful that we can move past this! Also -- to those who suggested Sam invite a female friend to our group, she reached out to one of her best friends from high school who still lives in the area, and she is interested in joining! I think Sam will feel more comfortable, and it'll take some of the spotlight off our new relationship if we invite a new player into our group. Anyway, wanted to update and thank everyone again for all your kind comments.**",

I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around.\n\nBecause of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated.\n\nToday I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days.\n\nEdit 1: Some edits based on comments.\n\nEdit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys.\n\nEdit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.\n\nTL;DR! - Took the advice of fellow redditors and broke up with my ex and spent probably the best year of my life.",

      "body": "Previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cvljeo/i_28f_am_getting_tired_of_my_bf_28m_getting_upset/).\n\nWell, Reddit. We broke up. Two weeks after I posted the above, we got into a fight because I was surprised to see him in the kitchen when I had just saw him in the bedroom. I said, \"Oh you're up!\" He responded by rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders and demanding, \"Is that a problem?!\"\n\nI said \"Of course not, I was just surprised!\" and went on to do the laundry. He left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. He gave me one-word answers when I tried talking to him. I guessed he needed time to himself so I went into the living room to call my friend. As I was talking to her I heard him leave the apartment. \n\nAfter I finished talking to her about 20 minutes later, I went out to find him playing Pokemon Go. I tried talking to him like normal and he kept giving me one-word answers, not looking at me. I finally asked him what was wrong. He said nothing. I said to tell me. He said he didn't feel welcome in my apartment because of my \"tone.\"\n\nFor listeners who heard the previous fights, you'll know my \"tone\" and the \"wordings\" of my sentences were things that triggered him a lot. Even if they were innocent statements like, \"I thought you were traveling on Monday?\" or anything else that somehow threatened him and made him immediately defensive.\n\nUnlike other times, where we would launch into a fight that would last hours or DAYS because he would insist I would have a tone, I would say I didn't mean it that way, and apologize, and it wasn't enough, this time we managed to pass through it fairly unscathed (and due mostly to my patience, if I may say).\n\nBut then later that day he told me how annoying my indecision was. That I could never relax. \n\nThat night I wanted to see some friends for a few hours because I had only interacted with him for several weeks at that point and I needed some social time. He said that was fine--he's always said that would be fine (as if I needed his permission). So I went out.\n\n25 minutes away from home and nearly at my destination, he messages me about how he feels lonely, he's going back to his home country soon, he wishes I hadn't gone out, we don't have much time left together, we were supposed to spend the whole day together (this was news to me).\n\nIt takes a lot of effort for me to keep down the anxiety and just enjoy time with my friends before going home.\n\nWe argue for two hours about it, even though there are several times when I point out he's repeating himself, that HE said he didn't even know he would feel that way so how could I anticipate his needs? It occurred to me that he often would do that--wait until it was too late to change something, complain about it and make it my fault. Like when he accused me of leaving him alone to fend for himself at a party for an hour (it was 15 minutes, I was watching the clock knowing he was insecure and didn't like social gatherings), or that I was with my friend he didn't like the whole time (I talked to my friend for less than 5 minutes the whole night because I had one eye on the clock and the other on my boyfriend). Why didn't he get up and talk to me during the party and tell me that? Why did he wait until the party was over and we were home and he held it over my head? \n\nOr the time we got back from a tropical island and he says he \"wishes we could have relaxed more,\" when I was the one who planned the trip and was driving and why did it not occur to him to tell me at any time he just wanted to relax somewhere? I thought it was relaxing because he was just in the car talking with me and playing Pokemon Go anyway while I was doing the driving, was it really not that relaxing?\n\nOr that time he was mad at me ALL day because he thought I was mad at him and I had made some remark that he took personally (shock), and he didn't tell me why he was being quiet until hours later and after I pryed and begged for him to tell me.\n\nThis kind of shit. All the time, you guys, holy shit.\n\nThe day of the reckoning. He finally leaves my country. He's back in his home country. Messages me how he feels like he failed us and he doesn't want to be home. I respond compassionately but say he needs to get rest because he's been traveling so long and hasn't eaten and I wanted to give the discussion of his feelings the time and love they needed and we couldn't when it was 3 AM there and he had to be up for work at 7 AM.\n\nHe goes cold. He goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up. Still cold. One-word answers. I'm used to it now.\n\nBut now I'm fed up. \n\nI call him out on his behavior. I tell him I'm sick of him going hot and cold with me. He says I didn't \"comfort\" him the way he wanted me to. I reiterate what I had said. He reiterates that it's not what he wanted to hear. \n\nWe break up later that day. We're both sad. Despite the bad times we had good times too, otherwise it would have been easier to let go. I'm disappointed in myself for saying I still didn't recognize the emotional abuse. I said we could try again. He says we couldn't. We both cry. We both apologize. We both thank each other for the good times.\n\nNext morning. He wakes up. Pissed. Mad I didn't give him a chance. Mad he has nothing to show for our relationship. Mad at all the sacrifices he made.\n\n(Sidenote: after the last fight I posted about, he had said to me: \"I look at all the sacrifices I've made and I wonder, what have you sacrificed? Are you worth it?\" To give you an idea, that is the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me, and it was the beginning of the end of our relationship. I opened up my home to him, cooked him vegetarian meals, tried to introduce him to other people so he didn't feel lonely, took him out and explored the country with him, tried to cheer him up, planned all our trips...it was NEVER enough. What was I sacrificing? My time. My energy. My mental health. My personal freedom. My social time with my friends. Everything.)\n\nIt was like he always expected the worst in me, and would only ever see what he wanted to see.\n\nSo we haven't talked since, after he chewed me up and spit me out and accused me of never listening to his feelings and always blaming him for everything. That I should have told him how I felt sooner, that I should have heard him out on an apology (that he apparently had no intention to actually get better from, just feel bad that it happened at all and repeat the same behaviors as infinitum).\n \nIf any of this rings true to you...please get out. I started reading, \"Why Does He Do That?\" since I saw it recommended on this sub several times a day. It's opening my eyes to what I put up with. The unhealthy behaviors. The emotional abuse. The mental exhaustion I have suffered.\n\nI won't lie. I miss who he was in the beginning. The sweet guy. The promises. The love. The care. The above-and-beyond romantic gestures. But they had vanished only months into the relationship--after we exchanged I love you's--and then the jealousy came out. The insecurity. Nitpicking what I said and how I said it. Even how I apologized wasn't good enough. His controlling tendencies. He demanded I not talk to my friends about it—even after the break up he asked that I not talk to our mutual friends about our break up. \n\nI could never make him happy.\n\nPlease, please, if you read this and think it reminds you of your relationship...please know you can do better. I am single now and have been the last two weeks, but the moment we broke up I felt relief. I felt a weight being lifted off of me. I have my time again. I can do what I want, when I want, without worrying how he will feel or how he will react or how long our fight will last or trying to manage the anxiety he made me feel.\n\nIt can get better. \n\nLook up “signs of emotional abuse” and click the link with over 60 examples. Google “why does he do that PDF” and just read the first ten pages online. If it resonates with you, then know that you have taken a very essential first step towards a happier, healthier you.\n\nI know I still have some ways to go. I am still trying to convince myself it was an emotionally abusive relationship, that I was not overreacting, that I can't go back, that I can do better, that my future self deserves better, that he was not the one. I had been so sure he was. But I just have to keep trusting my gut. It's hard not messaging him. I feel pathetic for even considering it. I used to be stronger. Maybe I'm still strong. I just have to get it back. Keep practicing. Keep being strong.\n\nAnyway. Thank you for reading.\n\ntl;dr I left my emotionally abusive relationship. Thank you to everyone who messaged and helped me see what he was doing was not okay. Thank you for the brave people who post about their unhappiness with their spouses and helped me see things must be able to get better. For making me feel less alone. Just...thank you. &lt;3\n\nEdit: The overwhelming support. I can’t keep up but I’m reading every comment. Thank you for helping to convince me I’m not crazy. Thank you for sharing your own painful stories. Thank you for reaching out and leaving comments or messages to send hope and love. Thank you for your support. You are all lovely people, and I hope you are all enjoying happy and healthy lives and relationships. Take care of yourselves.",

I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn’t go on with such little help anymore. \n\nWe wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don’t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn’t realise How ‘unequal’ the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he’d change.\n\nWe take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it’s working very well.\n\nNow we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he’s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He’ll read stories and is being much more involved.\n\nI still do a lot which I’m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that’s what I’m happiest with doing. I’m just appreciative of the help he’s now giving me. I don’t feel alone anymore. \n\nI think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he’s feeling overwhelmed, I’ll do more and vice versa.\n\nI do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now. \n\nWe also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind. \n\nI do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I’m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I’m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a “secondary “ parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple. \n\nI might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer.\nI know this isn’t the most amazing update and it’s just a case of communicating better but you’ve all helped so much and I’m very appreciative. I love reddit!\n\nThanks for all your comments/advice. \n\n\nTLDR : a case of communicating better and following your advice has helped us thanks so much",

      "body": "Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare\\_situation\\_me35f\\_with\\_partner40m\\_my\\_son/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nb1jcp/nightmare_situation_me35f_with_partner40m_my_son/)\n\nHi again everyone. I posted about my family problem about a month ago and was bowled over by the amount of kind and extremely helpful comments I got. Someone requested an update, so I'm posting now to tell you what's happened since. To be honest it's also to unburden myself, the boys are really sweet but I obviously can't talk to them about these things and there aren't a lot of people in my life I feel comfortable sharing all the details with. I suppose I'm embarrassed.\n\nThe week after my original post, I met with a family lawyer I know to go over options. I actually wrote down the legal suggestions posted here to discuss with her, but unfortunately, after going over each and several others in detail, we had to conclude that for each one, while it might technically be feasible, it would either take too long to be practical, or require things from Bob or from Ben which for various reasons were not ideal. Following the meeting, I was mulling things over and decided to take a long hard look at our finances to see what might be affordable as a compromise, such as perhaps sending Ben to a GOOD boarding school and pay tuition up front, so that if I then left Bob it would be easier and cheaper for him to leave Ben there rather than move him to a different school.\n\nAnyway, I went over our financial records with a fine-toothed comb, and that's when I discovered Bob was cheating on me, and had been for the entirety of our relationship. It turns out that, prior to Ben's parents' death, Bob had been about to move in with another woman. This woman didn't want kids, so when Bob was suddenly faced with taking custody of Ben or seeing him placed in foster care, she made it clear she would not be involved (for the record I can't say I blame her - I love my boys with all my heart, but asking someone who never wanted kids to parent a bereaved 11 year old she has never met is not in anyone's best interests in my opinion). When I confronted him about the affair, he didn't even attempt to deny it. He seemed ashamed (good!!) and just asked what happened next, so I told him that next he was going to get his stuff and get out of my house, but first ask Ben if he wants to go or stay, because it wouldn't be fair to disrupt the poor kid's life any further. Ben quickly said he preferred to stay, and Bob seemed frankly relieved. He moved out that weekend and I haven't seen him since. We've been in touch by text to discuss financial arrangements, though, and last week he sent me money to cover Ben's basic expenses (nothing like as much as child support, but under the circumstances I'll take it and be glad). From his attitude I take it that he's seeing this as a longterm thing, but even he doesn't, according to the family lawyer, his leaving Ben with me even for a while, along with Ben's age and the fact that Bob is his guardian rather than his father, would make it easier to build a case for Ben to stay even if Bob does try to fight it. The lawyer is confident that such a battle could be won, or at least dragged out till Ben is 18 and it doesn't matter anymore. So that, as you can imagine, has been an enormous relief.\n\nThat makes it that much harder to admit that finding out about Bob has still hit me hard. The fact is that, even though I was absolutely done with him and wanted him out, there was a time I truly believed he wanted to be with me and that we could build a life together. I knew our relationship wasn't a romance for the ages or anything like that, but it was by far the best I'd had since before my son was born and I really thought we cared for and valued one another. Now I realise that all he ever wanted from me was a mother for Ben. He as good as admitted it, and in retrospect it makes complete sense. That's why he never wanted to get married or buy into my house even though I offered (though now of course I am grateful!), because he wanted to make it as easy as possible to split from me once Ben was old enough to no longer require my services. I think it might even explain why he was so hard on Ben and grasping at straws for a reason to send him away. I never expected it of him based on what else I knew or I never would have been with him, but if he was blaming Ben for getting in the way of his life and simultaneously feeling guilty for, that could turn a mild-mannered person mean I think. Maybe he even thought if Ben was away most of the time the other woman would be willing to compromise for a few years? I don't know. I've even been wondering whether he decided to pursue me before we'd even met (the boys met first through an extracurricular where they became friends. It's possible that Jason mentioned my being single in passing, allowing Bob to identify me as potentially 'suitable' before we ever met).\n\nI'm sorry this is such a mopey post, I truly am grateful for the way things worked out, I think it's the best possible solution for everyone under the circumstances, and not one I could have achieved without Bob's 'help'. And the boys have been wonderful, they didn't know I was trying to get Bob out anyway so they've been treating me very gently (or as gently as you can expect teenage boys to be, anyway) and trying to pretend they aren't thrilled Bob is gone when I'm in the room. I'm glad of that, to be honest. I AM so grateful he's gone and Ben is still safe here with us, I just need a bit of time to really remember it, I think.\n\nTL;DR: It turns out Bob has been cheating on me most likely for the entire duration of our relationship. He's moved out and left Ben with me.",

      "title": "UPDATE TO: I [21/M] have been looking for my sister [18/F] since 2014. I found a way to contact her last night, but I'm not sure how to do it.",
      "body": "This is an update to [this post I made in January last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uknz2/i_21m_have_been_looking_for_my_sister_18f_since/). Not many people saw it but I figured I'd update anyway because I got some good advice and, I don't know, the outcome might be something good to read while having a poo or whatever. Fair warning, this is a lot longer than I expected it to be.\n\n\n**tl;dr (for the original)**: Sister has been involuntarily no contact with me since my parent's divorce. She lives with my narcissistic mother who would do anything to make sure I never see her again. I've found a way to contact her and I want to do it, but I don't want to step in her life and fuck it up for her. What's the best way to proceed?\n\n---\n\n**Update:** Well, I'm 23 now. Finished university, starting a real job, Dad and I no longer have depression, life is pretty good. As for my sister, a few interesting things happened to say the least. Firstly - I took the overall consensus from the original post and didn't make any attempt to contact her. I did drunkenly check her the page from time to time to see if anything had changed, and I found that I'd be unblocked on my main facebook account. Probably around August that same year, my sister rang my aunt and said she wanted to arrange a meeting with her and her son (our cousin, obviously). My aunt immediately rang my Dad and I and told us the good news, we were both uncertain about how we should take it but overall we were pretty happy. \n\nThey all meet up and apparently my sister has also been kicked out of our mother's house for some reason or another and is staying with a friend, and she hasn't spoken to my mother for over a year (at this point in November). The story goes that my mother and her new victim managed to ostracise themselves from all their friends down there and my mother took out her aggression on my sister, so she stormed out and turned up teary-eyed at this friends house and has been living with them ever since. She asked about me and my father, if we were doing well, and if we 'hate her'. Obviously my aunt assured her that we definitely don't. My sister says that she wants to get in contact with the both of us but she wants to take it slow and she didn't know how we would react. In my view that's completely understandable\\*.  That's interesting point #1.\n\n\n\n^\\*Just ^(as a side note, my mother once smacked my sister in the face for wasting a tampon when she was 12. I obviously am not completely familiar with that uniquely female experience but I did get the joy of hearing that moment unfold - just for an idea of the type of person my mother is and what she did to us both as kids.)\n\n\n**Interesting point #2** happens when my sister goes, with her new boyfriend, up to visit our Nan\\*. Another cousin of ours (big family) is also present for this meeting. My cousin tells me that my sister told our Nan that it had been 'a few months' since she had last spoken to our mother, which is quite a bit different to 'over a year ago'. Whatever, maybe my Aunt misremembered the meeting. However, my cousin did say that she got a very 'off' vibe from my sister, and to paraphrase her own words heavily, 'you would think [Sister] had last seen us all last weekend - not 5 years ago. She walked in to [Nan's] house like she owned the fucking place. She didn't really say why she was getting in contact with us and not [you or her father] other than she \"wasn't ready\", and she didn't really say why she hadn't spoken to her mother either. I don't know, I wasn't happy with it at all, and we were all thinking that you two [my father and I] should be in that room, not us. But maybe [your mother] has made me too paranoid.'\n\n^\\*My ^(Nan is my maternal grandparent. I phone her as often as I can which isn't as often as I would like it to be admittedly and I know I'll kick myself for it. I digress - every time I do phone her, she always asks about my Dad and his new partner, and sends them both Birthday cards, Christmas cards, so on. To me it just speaks volumes about the type of person my Mother is when her mother is more concerned about the wellbeing of her ex-husband and his new partner. Just tryna get this point home to any doubters.)\n\n**#3** occurs when I find out that my sister asked my Nan for some money to help her out with University and not living with her Mother anymore. My Nan, being the lovely little 86 year old Welsh sweetheart that she is, gave her around £2,000. Now, I'm happy to be proven wrong here, but asking for £2,000 within a few hours of reconnecting with family that you haven't seen or made contact with for *five years* is very strange. I find out about this, because around November my Nan called me - because she had promised me an update on the situation - to tell me that for about a week after my Sister met up with them all, they had been in regular contact via phone and Facebook. Since that week - nothing. Unreturned voicemails, Facebook messages left on read, my sister had taken the money and fucked off. I spent the day reassuring my Nan that she hadn't done anything wrong, and she definitely wasn't the idiot she thought she was for giving my sister the money. \n\n**#4** is the least interesting, but you'll be pleased to know that my ramblings end here at least. It should go without saying that since the first meeting in August with my aunt and her son, neither my Dad nor I have had any direct contact with my sister. On Boxing day, my sister *finally* calls my Nan and wishes her a merry Christmas. My Nan says thanks and hangs up. In January, on my Nan's 87th birthday, my sister calls up and wishes her a happy birthday, and also mentions that she's having some money problems. My Nan rolls her eyes and hands the phone to my Aunt who buys my Sister's sob story hook, line, and sinker, and rings me to tell me the, quote unquote, \"good news\" and that \"it's different this time, she really wants to see you\". \n\nAround May (which is my Birthday month btw), my sisters sends a text to my Aunt to see if she has any old pictures of her. My aunt says she doesn't, but that me and my Dad might (which we do). My sister sends a text back saying that she will get in touch with us. \n\nI know this is gonna come as a complete shock, but it's been radio silence since and in all honesty I'm fine with that. To me, it's crystal clear who my sister has grown up to be like. Toying with family members emotions, treating her own presence as a gift and using it to manipulate money out of people, inconsistent stories about her relationship with the one person she knows would be a deal-breaker if the rest of the family knew was still involved, and terrible at hiding her true intentions. Will she ask me for the photos? Probably not. Unless she gets really desperate and exhausts all other avenues for exploiting money out of people with pity stories, but even she knows that I know exactly who that money is going to. My mother knows that she's not in my Nan's will at this point. \n\nIf she does want to meet up, I will bring the photos with me. Part of me wants to bring two envelopes - half of the photos in one envelope, the other half shredded up in another, and depending on how well the meeting goes depends on which envelope she gets. I won't do that but it the thought of being that petty is very tempting. \n\nI'm not holding my breath. She was 14 and I was 17 the last time I saw her; she's turning 21 this year and I was 23 in May. I've had my years of anger and grief and done my time with depression, I've hurt many people and many relationships along the way. I'm still learning what's normal and what isn't, but on the whole my life is split up into *before* and *after*, and for the most part my sister lives and will remain in the *before*. Somewhat because I want to maintain the memory I have of her and not taint it by knowing what she has become, somewhat because I'm not ready to go through what I overcame again. I've accepted my role in the universe as the recipient of bad karma to make up for all the good karma that randomly happens to other people. I'm okay with that; for the first time in my life, I've been the one in control. As for my attitude to her and my mother, the best word I could adequately use to describe it is \"ambivalent\". They could win the lottery and be on the news tomorrow or they could get hit by a bus - my reaction would probably be the same. \n\n To everyone else out there with estranged parents or other family members - the one thing I learned is that estrangement is the best thing they'll ever do for you.\n\n\n\n**tl;dr**: I didn't contact her, and it turned out to be a good thing, but not for the reasons I thought.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your comments, I did my best to reply to everybody but given the response to the original post I had no idea this would get so much attention. \n\n* To the people that shared their similar stories, I hope you're all keeping well and staying positive and making the most out of what you've been dealt in life. Hard times make strong people. \n\n* In reference to my idea of ripping up the photos, that was always only ever half-serious. I wouldn't do something like that; it's petty, wouldn't be fair to my sister, and would only give me short term satisfaction in the form of a pathetic 1-up. I realised that before writing this post \n\n* In reference to the 'bad karma' line, I actually think I'm a very lucky man all things considered. I'm where I want to be in life, I have a fun and happy and stable family around me, and I'm confident in the person I've become. That line is a glimpse into my personality - some people got that, some people were genuinely concerned for me which I do sincerely appreciate. The black dog never really stops chasing you, but I get a much warmer feeling from being able to laugh at a universe that is seemingly constantly shitting on you than I do from pretending that everything is okay; that's what I meant by that line. \n\nThanks again to everyone for taking the time to read, it felt good to get this off my chest and know that a lot of people think I'm making the right moves. A good amount of people made the fair comment that my sister is still young and still possibly under my Mother's influence. I appreciate those people taking the time to give feedback and advice, but ultimately my life had already moved on. I made peace with the fact that I may never see my sister again long before the events I've detailed out here, and when this all kicked off the closure and acceptance I had moved on from began to unravel. I'm not ready to go back into dark days off of a risk that everything might be okay. Yes, in the future we may reconnect, but for now I am focused on my own life and am content with taking some of the rare happy memories I had of my family in my childhood with me, untouched by these developments.",

      "body": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e3b49g/my_33_f_roommates_29_f_dog_is_literally_killing_me\n\nThank you everyone so much for your advice. It gave me the confidence boost I needed to go to the higher ups. \n\nMy roommates behavior had progressively gotten worse after posting. She had stopped bathing the dog to protest being fired and kicked out, (also a fuck you to my allergies), she had stopped sorting recycling and started throwing trash away in the recycling bins, taking other people’s food, and several other things that just make you say WTF?! \n\nI knew after seeing what you guys were saying and seeing that behavior from her, I had to speak up and be so loud that no one could ignore me. I also knew I had to make the hard choice of resigning and moving back home if the company wasn’t going to take my worries seriously. \n\nSince it is company housing, I demanded a hearing with the company heads and the landlord. \n\nI took my visit summaries from doctors appointments and told them how this needed to stop and the move out date needed sooner. If that didn’t happen I would be forced to resign. \n\nThey were appalled and they wished I would have spoken up sooner. A mistake I will never make again. They made up a new contract they made her sign pushing the move out date to Jan 25th. \n\nThey also stripped her of some company items (phone & computer) they were going to let her previously keep. She’s going to be banned from company property as well after that date. In addition to all of this, the company will be reimbursing me for any medical bills I have because of the dog allergies. \n\nI think this is the best outcome I could have gotten realistically. Thanks you guys once again. \n\nTL;DR update: my roommate got crazier, I went to company heads and landlord, they moved up the kick out date, gave strict sanctions, and are covering any medical bills I have because of it.\n\nEdit to add: They are hiring professional cleaners and someone to clean out the HVAC vents after Jan 25th. \n\nAlso if the roommate is still here after that date the company told me they will have locks changed and police escort them out if needed. There’s no wiggle room with this new contract.",

I would have rather anything else happened but this.\n\nShe was in a bad car crash.\n\nHer sister had my old phone number (I changed phones a couple months ago) so I did not receive any of her calls. And when I texted/called her, they just went to spam. So, she messaged me on LinkedIn.\n\nShe told me that my girlfriend was in a car crash and is in the hospital right now. She was in and out of consciousness for about 3.5ish days. My girlfriend just woke up and became somewhat alert this morning. I called her and she seemed like her normal joking self - she told me to sell our shiba inu coins that we bought as a joke.\n\nHer sister said my girlfriend said she can't feel her legs so the doctors are going to do scans and tests. But other than some scratches/bruises and some sore spots, she has a sprained wrist. I saw the pictures and its a miracle she is not dead. The car is gone. I liked that car, it was a nice car.\n\nI am flying out tomorrow morning to visit her.\n\nI am just in shock. I don't know what to think.\n\nTL;DR - Her sister messaged me and my girlfriend was in a bad car crash.",

      "body": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nakwe1/i_29f_am_unsure_on_how_to_put_the_moves_on_my/)\n\nTl;dr of last post: Due to coming off some long term medication, I have a sex drive for the first time in about 10 years. Realized I have no idea how to hit on my husband or initiate in general.\n\nMy last post didn't get a ton of attention, but I thought I would update people anyways. I took most everyone's advice and talked to my husband. He thought the whole situation was hilarious (in a nice way). But he was very reassuring. I told him about my fears of rejection, or doing something wrong. How my body issues have made it difficult to initiate because I fear I wont be able to turn him on. He gave me some ideas on how I might come on to him, what subtle moves might work to help initiate. He also reassured me that unless something major was going or he was sick, he would pretty much always reciprocate. He soothed my body fears and told me he finds me very attractive and I shouldn't worry about that. \n\nYou guys, this has been life changing. Talking with my husband completely alleviated my fears. After a couple of false starts, I was able to start initiating. And its been going great. We're both all over each other all the time, just like we were highschoolers again. Maybe even better. Thank you so much everyone for convincing me to just talk to my husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Talked to my husband. Things worked out perfectly. It's like were 16 again.",

      "body": "**UPDATE:** \n\nThank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like \"father figure\" or \"guardian angel\" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything.\n\nAlso!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know! \n\nAlso also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?  \n\nThanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!!\n\n**ORIGINAL POST:**\n\nMost of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  \"You just need to be a barber.\"  I laughed, and he reiterated, \"No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber.\"\n\nFlash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!\n\nDuring every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.\n\nThis is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.\n\nHe has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like \\*I\\* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy guardian angel helped (and is still helping me) get my shit together, and I'm an awkward man baby that feels like I have a new father and want to tell him I immensely appreciate him but don't know how to not seem weird about it?",

      "body": "UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/l5jc7c/update_my_29m_soon_to_be_exhusband_seems_to_feel/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\n\nMy husband and I have been together almost 8 years, married for 2 and half of those .Last May (2019) we seperated seemingly overnight. He left me and our toddler and moved back to his hometown. There was never a solid reason given, just that he felt we should have never gotten married. In July, he changed his tune and wanted to be a family again. He was still at his job in his hometown, so I decided I would ride it out at my job in a different city for a couple of months to build my resume and then start looking for other jobs in his hometown. After 6 months of a brutal commute, taking care of our child during the week by myself and driving to his hometown EVERY weekend, interviewing, basically bending over backwards, I finally landed a great job in December. A week before I was to move into the new house we were buying together and start my new job, I found out he had been having an affair. He begged and pleaded for me to stay with him, said he’d break off all contact, and I foolishly agreed to give him another chance. Two days later while I was back in the different city and completing my last week of work at my old job, he unblocked her on everything and liked her pictures on Instagram. I was devastated. On top of that shit show, he kicked me out of the house we were supposed to move in together and I had to find a new place to live TWO days before starting my new position. We have lived seperately ever since. He has said and done so many hateful things in this time period, and said so many times that he wants a divorce that I’ve lost count. Up until a month ago he was still maintaining contact with her. I saw her car at his house, took pictures for the lawyers, etc. and he admitted he had been talking with her still. I stopped doing the “pick me dance” about a month ago and stopped reaching out to him besides contact about our child. Now he has suddenly changed his tune and is “desperate” to get me back and will do anything. He has unfollowed her on everything. Unliked all her pictures. Tells me not to give up on our family. I’ve moved on... I am not interested in pursuing another relationship with him. He’s hurt me deeply and I feel like I’ve been fucked over by him so many times that I’ve lost count. How can I tell him there isn’t a chance without sounding like a completely heartless person? I still want to be able to maintain a strong coparenting relationship with him, so I am friendly to him, but he seems to take that as I want him back. I have relayed to him my feelings, but they fall on deaf ears. He says he will never stop trying to get our family back together and does not want a divorce. I do. Does anyone have advice? \n\n\nTL;DR: husband cheated and left me, was adamant he wanted a divorce, now when I want one too he changes his tune.\n\n\nEdited to add, just to show the kind of person he is: When I asked him about the reason for his sudden change of heart, he said it was because I “seemed stronger”. Ahhh, the irony. Honestly, a big thank you to the prick for yanking the rug under my feet not once, but twice, because I truly have realized how much better I can do and how I don’t need anyone but myself to have a happy life.\n\n2nd Edit: Seriously, thank you to everyone who has read my story and commented. You have no idea how much it’s helping me to focus on myself and realize I need stop considering the feelings of someone who had no consideration of mine. I only hope that anyone who is in a similar situation realizes that you CAN and you DO move on. And I promise that you will feel like a 10,000 pound weight has been lifted off your back.\n\n3rd Edit: He is being served papers in the next 1-2 weeks. Guarantee the “I’ve Changed” mask slips off. I hope I’m wrong...but I’ve learned all too well that my gut feelings are usually spot on. Hopefully I’ll be back with an update in a few months with the good news that the split is official!",

      "body": "My boyfriend (26) was in a relationship with a girl for 3 years from 20 to 23. She's from the other side of the world and missed her home to much so eventually she went back and that's why they broke up.\n\nOver the 9 months that I've been with my boyfriend he's told me a few things about her, all postive. From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt.\n\nWell today it got weird. Apparently when they broke up she gave him a letter. Amongst other things it says that she wishes him happiness blah blah. But then it says that he should give another letter to the girl he finds love with again. Apparently she enclosed that letter. \n\nHe gave it to me unopened. I didn't know what to expect. But she was so nice in her letter. Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy.\n\nI just feel weird. This woman seems to be a saint. I don't know how to feel about this letter and the whole thing. Should I contact her? But what would I even say? Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her? Somehow this letter made me jealous because I could feel a level of closeness that I don't have with my boyfriend. What should I make of this?\n￼\nTldr. Bf gave me a letter his ex wrote to me.",

      "body": "Link to my update post: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52r6o3/update_i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after/\n\nMy fiancé, \"Dale\", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.\n\nDale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.\n\nI used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line \"Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...\"\n\nThe subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. \"Jen\" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.\n\nRest of the subject line was \"Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?\"\n\nThe email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.\n\nEven worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like \"she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it.\" And then she answered with a bunch of \"lol\"s and said she felt sorry for the \"poor girl\". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. \n\nThat is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of \"if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.\"\n\nBut to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.\n\nThe emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.\n\nObviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses \"backdoor\". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.\n\nI'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.\n\nI'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now.\n\n**tl;dr** fiancé made fun of me and sent explicit emails to his ex. Just found them. Heartbroken, angry, hurt, every emotion ever going on. Don't know if I should just ghost him and never see him again or confront him? I need nice words from Internet strangers or something right now.",

      "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7awaf0/my_best_friend_22f_is_giving_up_a_fullride/\n\nJust found this throwaway account and thought I should give an update! My friend and I are now 25, and we’re still close. She did transfer schools and lose her scholarship. She also graduated late because of the transfer. In all, it cost her more than $30k in student loans, which she regrets.\n\nThings did not work out between her and her boyfriend. He really wanted to live a party boy lifestyle with her at home to cook and clean up after him. They broke up one year after she transferred. She still had a semester left, which was really difficult and lonely because she had no friends aside from him and his social circle.\n\nAfter graduation, she got a job as a teacher in her hometown. So she does have a way to pay back the loans! She’s pretty happy. She’s now engaged to a different guy she started dating ~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. Yes, it’s fast, but they live together with no issues. They aren’t going to start planning a wedding until COVID eases up. She’s less gullible now and more skeptical of her mom’s advice. Her experience really opened her eyes to the consequences of her choices.\n\nTL;DR My friend learned an expensive lesson, but her life turned out okay. She ended up where she probably would have if she didn’t transfer, but $30k in a hole. She’ll be the first to tell you to prioritize your future over a short-term relationship!",

He claimed I was the one who needed therapy because I had jealousy issues, and that my ex was one of his good buddies and I couldn’t dictate who he was friends with. \n\nThen a week later he had another hangout with my ex and his friends where he proceeded to very loudly tell them how I was so insecure, and I was trying to tell him who he could speak to. My ex and Luke had to tell him to stop which he didn’t like at all. I should’ve just broken up with him at this point, but I was stupid and still clinging to the hope of my boyfriend going back to how he was. After this happened, my boyfriend was constantly making jabs at my ex and Luke but then he would still contact them and pretend to be friends with them. \n\nThen, he became super interested in what my sex life was like with my ex. He was constantly asking me who was better between the two of them and he would ask me if I had done this or that with my ex. I kept telling him I didn’t want to talk about it and to stop asking me. I then find out from my ex and Luke that he had been asking my ex directly the same questions and that he had been bragging about our sex life to his friends. My ex said he was telling me because my boyfriend made a comment about loaning me to my ex if he ever felt like recreating old times. That was the final straw for me, and I broke up with him and moved out. \n\nMy now ex-boyfriend didn’t take the breakup well and he went on a smear campaign. He even contacted my family and my ex’s family to tell them we were apparently having an affair and that he had no choice but to break up with me. It’s been almost a month since we broke up and he keeps getting new numbers to text and call me.\n\nDeep down I think I knew this would be how things ended. I’m sad about the relationship I thought we had ending but now that I’ve had space away from my ex-boyfriend, I feel much better and it's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\n\nTL;DR – My boyfriend wasn’t willing to work on the relationship and he kept doing things to embarrass/upset me so I finally broke up with him.",

      "title": "My (22 F) parents (42 F, 44 M) are unbearable after the death of my fiancée (23 F) and I don't know how to cope.",
      "body": "TLDR: My parents have been trying to get me to move on really fast, get me to do all my classwork as if nothing happened, are pretty homophobic, and have been calling my late fiancée terrible things and I do not know how to cope.\n\nSo, I woke up to my fiancée being dead on Wednesday, April 1st 2020. She died unexpectedly and I don't want to go into the details of her death with strangers yet but it has been the largest, most traumatic event of my life. On the first day, I called her parents (50s M/F) who came and picked me up to stay with them for a week because my parents lived across the country and I just couldn't handle being alone in our apartment anymore. Me and her family, which are very kind and accepting people, grieved together and comforted each other. They were extremely sweet and kind people and I was very lucky to get to stay with them when it first happened. \n\nHowever, my parents were also informed of my fiancée's death and made the long, multiple day drive across the country to come. They packed up my apartment for me because I just couldn't go back there (which was very kind of them) and picked me up the night after her funeral to take me to my childhood home. The first thing my mom did was complain about her own problems and how disrespectful/inconsiderate I was to not thank her right away or something. I don't really remember exactly what it was about but I didn't have the energy to argue or put up with her so I just mumbled some answers and tried to remain quiet.\n\nThen, later in the night as we were trying to go to sleep, my mom decided to start asking why my fiancée didn't care for her that much and I explained it was because she is homophobic. My mom then went into a huge screaming tirade about how she didn't want her daughter to be a lesbian (I remember her actual quote being \"Well, I'm sorry that I don't want my daughter to become a lesbian!\") and how us holding hands when she visited us last year was extremely disrespectful. (When she visited us last yet, she made my fiancée break down and cry so hard I had to drive my fiancée somewhere to be without my mom for an extended period of time.) I just cried quietly to myself until she stopped screaming and we went to sleep.\n\nAround the first few days after my fiancée's death, I would wake up crying and in a panic. Her parents would just hug me and we would cry and talk until I was able to calm down, but my mom that morning reacted by screaming at me. She was saying things like \"Stop crying!\" and \"I hate [fiancée] now!\" and \"If she was alive, I'd kill her because you just keep crying!\" and just similar stuff. It made everything worse and I just wanted to throw up for the beginning of our long drive home. She also kept taunting me by saying she was going to put me in a mental health hospital or whatever it's called.\n\nOn the drive home, she kept bringing up negative topics any chance she got. During all these she called my fiancée a slut and a whore. She said that my fiancée \"looked like someone who would sleep around.\" and just tried to disgrace her character. She then tried to convince me that my fiancée was toxic and controlling (she wasn't) and that she must've been abusive because she was driving a wedge between me and my family. It hurt me to even think that fiancée was abusive when she did nothing but care about me and was tender and loving to me.\n\nWhen I was talking about how smart and beautiful my fiancée was, she kept saying I was smarter and prettier than my fiancée which just made me feel incredibly crappy. Sometimes, she would then have these strange mood swings where she would say \"If I could, I would kill myself so [fiancée] could be alive. That's what you really want, don't you?\" and when she would ask that, she would demand and answer and I just didn't know how to answer and I would end up crying harder. She also kept trying to say she knows what I'm going through and I have to toughen up but she married the first person she ever dated, so she never even went through a breakup before.\n\nShe would also continuously joke (?) about how she was going to buy me a blow up doll and dress her in my fiancée's clothes and it just made me feel so sick and uncomfortable and terrible when she would make that joke. She still makes that joke and now has my dad in on it.\n\nWhen we got home, I thought I was going to stay with my grandparents (70s M/F) but my mom informed me that I would have to stay with her or my sister (20 F) because I might have the Coronavirus and she wouldn't want me to give it to my grandparents, who currently have my emotional support cat at their house because my parents and sister both have dogs. My childhood best friend (20 F) also came over to stay with me for a couple weeks (which is a blessing) but she only feels comfortable staying with my parents because my sister doesn't take good care of her house. So, I'm currently at my parents house.\n\nAnyway, the day I got home, I went to my sister's house for a little bit to get away from my parents but my dad just ended up calling me on my phone and screaming at me that I only have a week (starting from Friday) to cry and get over it, then I would have to work and not be seen moping around or upset about it again. He also continued to call my fiancée a selfish bitch and told me that I needed to forget about her and get on with my life. This made me just break down. I called my \"mother in law\" (for lack of better term) and just cried to her about everything and I think she really doesn't like my parents now. But, she told me that they are just trying to make me feel better by treating this like a breakup. My fiancée's family is extremely religious (but accepting) and so they believe that like people need to be with their blood families to heal, so I think they're just having a difficult time understanding how my parents could be so mean but they're starting to understand every time I talk to them about it. However, they're on the other side of the country and there is nothing they can do about it now anyway other than listen when I call them. My parents don't want me to call them because they say that her family needs to grieve and I'm bothering them so now I'm really worried I'm just bothering her parents.\n\nI also made it clear to my parents that I'm changing my last name to hers because that was our plan when we got married and it was important to me still and at first, when I told them on the phone a few days after she passed, they seemed okay with it but now that I'm here, they're throwing a huge dramatic show about it. They keep screaming about it and telling me that I can't change my name to a slut's name and that nobody would love me if I changed my name to hers and I'm just so worried that maybe they're right but I feel like it's necessary.\n\nMy parents' dog also has been growling at me every day because I'm new to him (they got him while I was gone and living with my fiancée) and my dad today yelled at me to stop \"moping around\" so the dog will stop growling at me because he thinks the dog growls at me due to my coldness or something. I don't know. I ended up breaking down in the shower because it's the only place I can be alone anymore (my room doesn't have a door) and I desperately miss my fiancée and the life we made together. \n\nI'm ashamed that I'm 22 and am living with my parents right now and I'm just depressed and anxious and scared. None of my coping mechanisms I have learned from my depression and anxiety therapist have worked and I don't know what to do anymore. \n\nWhat can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? I've always been somebody who just needs to be held and told sweet things to when bad stuff happens to make me feel okay again but they're just making everything worse. When I talk to them they just shrug it off. One time, I asked my mom if she could be nicer to me and she said \"I am being nicer than usual.\" I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to know what to tell them so they stop all this and become kind and sweet and consoling. I just need it and her family knew I needed it but they, for some reason, don't understand. I've been hugged and cuddled more by my once to-be in-laws than by my own parents after all this happened. Please tell me what to do to get them to understand and treat me better. Or just tell me what I should do. I don't know anymore. I'm struggling.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the long post. Please leave your suggestions of what I should do below. I can't keep the tears in much longer.",

      "body": "Link to original post: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52hka7/i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after_email_from/\n\nHey everyone. First off, thank you for caring so much about my situation. You all have great advice, encouragement, and you helped me hold on to the strength I need to make it through this. I still have a lot to get through and I'm hurting so much right now. It comes in waves; sometimes I feel so empowered and strong, then 10 minutes later I'm crying in a ball and feel like I can't move or do anything.\n\nLast night I texted Dale and told him that my best friend, \"Jake\", had gotten into a fight with his boyfriend and I was going to go stay with him so he could vent and have somebody with him.\n\nI told Jake what happened and showed him the emails (I took pictures of them on my phone in case I needed them for whatever reason). Jake and his boyfriend \"Mike\" (who he had obviously not gotten into a fight with and was there) were infuriated and we all just sort of cried together for a while.\n\nThey stayed up with me almost all night helping me figure out my next moves. We all agreed that taking the high road was the best route. We made a list of all the things that were necessary to get out of the apartment. Mike is a property manager for a different apartment complex so this morning he called my property manager and gave her a very condensed, detail-free version of what was happening. I have always thought it important to get to know your property manager in case you ever have a situation where they can help you out, so she always really liked me. Dale and I have been paying rent on a month to month basis for about 3 months because we were starting to look for houses to purchase after we settled down after the wedding. My property manager told Mike that working out getting my name off of the rental agreement wouldn't be a problem and to not worry about the 30 day notice that she typically requires for a tenant moving out.\n\nAs far as finances go, I make about 70% of our combined income and Dale only covers about 30%. When Jake, Mike, and I were discussing the logistics of me moving out, Mike brought up the point that Dale does not make enough to cover the required 3x rent in income each month. Meaning he will most likely be given notice to move out if he cannot find a roommate fast. We lived in a one bedroom so I doubt he'll be able to find someone quickly who is willing to sleep on a couch versus having their own bedroom. Especially since I purchased the couch, so... there isn't even one there anymore. The thought of this brings me great pleasure, as I'm sure you can imagine.\n\nJake and I each called out of work today and we rented one of those mover pick up trucks. We were pretty organized after making our list and it only took us a couple of trips to get my stuff out and into Jake and Mike's garage for the time being.\n\nDale texted me a couple of times asking how Jake is and if I'm coming home after work tonight. I told him I'm already home (not exactly a lie, I was there at the time) and then I said Jake was going to be okay and that I just couldn't believe how awful people can be to the people they love. Dale agreed and said that he was glad he had such a \"good girl\" like me. It was tempting to say something about how yeah, I'm just so vanilla that way. I didn't, I just told him to always remember that, how great I am to him. He said of course he would. That felt pretty satisfying and I hope he does remember that everyday for the rest of his life.\n\nWhoever it was that posted about the vanilla ice cream idea, Jake, Mike, and I laughed about that hysterically last night. It was the first thing that made me laugh like that and may be the only thing for a while, so thank you for that.\n\nI didn't end up ruining any of Dale's stuff, I didn't print out the emails and send them to his family/friends, I didn't do anything destructive or spiteful. However, after all my stuff was out, Jake and I made a trip to the grocery store. I took that poster's advice and I bought one of those big plastic tubs of vanilla ice cream. I left it on the counter with a note and my engagement ring. I wrote \"I know vanilla isn't your favorite flavor, but this is the only vanilla you'll be eating from now on. XOXO\". I mean... I am human. I had to leave him with a little bit of a bang.\n\nSo here I am. Staying with Mike and Jake for a while. Finding an apartment will be no issue for me, I am comfortable financially on my own with a stable job. I have to deal with the deposits I put down for the venues for both the wedding and the reception. I can't right now, I'm too much of a mess emotionally. I will by the week's end though as I know I can't put it off any longer if there's any hope at all of getting refunded. I had already booked our honeymoon but I did pay the extra for insurance if the trip needed to be cancelled. I honestly don't really know what exactly the insurance covers, I'll have to look into it. Wether or not I can get a refund for Dale's ticket, I will be going on my first trip out of the country on my own and I am happy about this. It's one bright thing to look forward to through this whole mess.\n\nI will sell my wedding dress- which was a low cut dress by the way and showed my scar off as much as a wedding dress can. I guess Dale would have found that gross. Or maybe I'll burn it. Burning it sounds kind of fun because I've been holding back so much on not being destructive in a time where I would have found great (albeit temporary) pleasure in burning everything Dale has ever owned. Burning my dress is something I can do privately that will still be satisfying. I can scream and cry and throw rocks at it, pour lighter fluid all over it, watch it burn, and then cook a s'more over it. Because I love s'mores so why not?\n\nI am walking away from Dale with my head held high. The best revenge is to walk away as dignified as possible and to not sink to his level. I was close with his family but I'm not going to worry about what he tells them. I am positive it won't be the truth- there is no way he's got the balls and decency to tell them what he did. But *I* know what he did, *he* knows what he did, and all the people who truly love me and who I am close with will know what he did. That's all that really matters. Though it's nice to have those emails just in case Dale tries to take things too far or something. I'm going to be okay. I'm having one of my empowered moments. Though I just spent the last hour in the bathtub sobbing. Like I said, waves. Jake told me that Dale isn't worthy of my \"quirky\" nipple and I agree.\n\nWhen I got in my accident, I was lucky that the shrapnel didn't pierce my heart. I did however suffer from a pretty significant heart contusion (basically a bruised heart) among other injuries. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. So yeah, this situation makes my heart hurt, but my heart has been through much worse and kept on ticking along. \n\nSorry if I rambled a lot, posting this to you all is like a form of therapy and the more thoughts that pop up in my mind, I just write them down for you all to read. I haven't told my family and other friends yet, I'll be tackling that soon. I'm glad the invites hadn't already been sent, at least I don't have to send out a cancellation notice. I deleted Dale off all social media and blocked his email address. I didn't block him off my phone yet because, honestly, I'm curious to his reaction. I can promise you all that I will not respond AT ALL. Not to a single text or call. But I can't help but be interested to see how he reacts. I will block him tomorrow though. Mike told me that the second his messages turn ugly or hateful because I'm not responding, block him. He doesn't want Dale to hurt me anymore than he already has. He's right and I really do plan to block him regardless by tomorrow after seeing his initial reaction.\n\nI guess that's all I have to update. Thank you all for caring about me. I will continue moving forward and I will never stop wearing clothes that show my scar. I've never hidden it before and I'm not going to let some asshole make me feel like I should. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for your love. You gave amazing comments and messages. I will never forget the nice things you all have said to me. Seriously, thank you!\n\nPS: I think I will dress up as Edward Scissorhands for Halloween.\n\n**tl;dr** got my stuff out of the apartment, left fiancé with basically no explanation. Besides a tub of vanilla ice cream and a little note. I'm feeling okay at this moment but it's been up and down all day and will continue to for a long time.\n\n**Edit:** So last night got pretty crazy. It started with Dale playing dumb and asking what was going on and what did he do? Like I promised all of you, I didn't respond. The dick knew exactly what he'd done. He just kept texting and kept texting. One text that I found particularly infuriating was \"I can't think of anything I have done to deserve this. Whatever you think I've done isn't true I'm sure you just misunderstood and I can explain. I mean damn you didn't have to be so dramatic and just leave me like this\".\n\nI love how he was already saying that I just misunderstood what I \"think\" he's done and that he can explain. He's such a shit person that he wouldn't  even just come out and admit to the emails and say he's sorry. And then to call me dramatic.\n\nThe texts progressed into angry ones. Here is a string of texts from him, word for word (except that I corrected some grammar because his grammar is ridiculous). Each text was probably sent about 2 minutes apart, sometimes less. Just so you understand the level of crazy here. I will refer to myself as \"Elle\" in these because he uses my name a lot and my real name starts with an \"L\" so seems appropriate. I blocked him after this, by the way.\n\n\"Baby you know how much I love you, I'm at a loss right now. I don't understand, why won't you answer me??\"\n\n\"I just tried calling. ELLE PLEASE PICK UP!\"\n\n\"We are getting married, I thought you cared about me. I guess I was wrong.\"\n\n\"I guess you are cold hearted.\"\n\n\"Elle??????\"\n\n\"Baby??\"\n\n\"Are you ok? At least answer me so I know you are ok and not hurt or something.\"\n\n\"Seriously?????\"\n\n\"ELLE!!!!\"\n\n\"Seriously you're a bitch.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that, I'm just getting really worried and upset.\"\n\nHe took about a 20 minute break between that one and this monstrosity:\n\n\"You know what, I did mean that. You're a f**king bitch for doing this. If you were unhappy you should have told me. I can't believe you would do this to me, I love you. You are just like your father but even worse because at least your mom is a c--t and so are you so who can blame him. Don't ever contact me again or come crawling back and good luck finding a guy who will love a f**king circus freak bitch. Lol lol lol, dumbass\".\n\nSo that's when I blocked him. I know nothing he said was true but still... this wasn't just an email to his ex, this was something he sent to me *directly*. I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard. This is someone I was planning a future with just a couple of days ago. He was so sweet, as far as I knew obviously. He used to kiss my hand almost every morning. It's just such a shock it's hard to wrap my mind around it.\n\nLast night was a really tough night to get through for me.\n\nI keep reading back what I wrote in this update last night and it helps to keep me feeling strong. I keep reading all of your lovely comments and messages from the original post and it helps to keep me feeling loved and strong. Jake and Mike are wonderful and I'm lucky to have them to hold my hand and help me through this. \n\nThough his texts hurt me, they also reaffirmed that he's a spineless weasel and that I 10000% did the right think by leaving. He's making it really easy to get over him.\n\nSorry this got so long, I wanted to really include you all in what's happening. Thanks for checking in on me and caring about what happens to me, love to you all!\n\n**Little update:** Wow! You are all amazing, wonderful people. So much love and support, I'm crying because of all your lovely, sweet messages. It's honestly so encouraging!\n\nI had the intention of responding to some comments but the post is now locked, so I just wanted to make sure to update this to say thank you! I hope you all see this.\n\nI had a lot of people pm me asking if there were any signs that Dale was an asshole so they know what kind of red flags to look out for. Honestly... no. I wish I could say yes to that so I could potentially prevent others from going through what I did or something similar. He was very attentive and loving, he never once made fun of my appearance (to my face), he seemed to appreciate my ambition and independence. I never felt controlled or criticized for being a financially stable, educated woman.\n\nI had a therapist after I lost my friend in the accident. My father had also walked out earlier that year so we were discussing this and how I hadn't seen it coming. My therapist told me that people can make you see whatever they want you to see but that they can't keep up the facade forever. Things almost always come to a head eventually. The only thing you can do is be secure enough with yourself to understand that the faults of others has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you surround yourself with enough good people that you can afford to lose one or two along the way. \n\nI suppose that would be my advice on the matter. Love people openly and let yourself be loved but always keep hold of yourself and make sure you have yourself covered should someone let you down along the way.\n\nAs far as the dress goes, I believe I will take the advice of many of you and donate it to flood victims in Louisiana. It is a beautiful gown. I think what I will burn instead is my reception dress. I've got to burn something. ;)\n\nThanks Reddit, I sincerely love all of you and wish you the best in all of your life endeavors! I might pop back up in a few weeks to update you all on how I'm doing.\n\n<3 Elle",

      "body": "Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8w5vf1/i_30f_just_found_my_fiance_30m_on_an_online/\n\nI posted a few days ago because I found my fiance on an online dating site. I took reddit's advice and catfished him...\n\nA few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted.\n\nWhen he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up.\n\nLong story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account.\n\nHe obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me.\n\nI fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure.\n\nI apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago.\n\nHe offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another \"trust but verify\" type of situation.\n\nTl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile. We talked it over, no one is mad.

      "body": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8547ag/my_boyfriend_25m_cannot_handle_being_alone_when_i/).\n\n\nIt's been eight months, and I thought I'd give an update.\n\n\nFirst of all, we're still together. The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of \"this is a major problem and will not go away\" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.\n\n\nThere are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:\n\n\n\n* He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it\n\n* Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together. \n\n\nThese two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:\n\n\nOver the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.\n\n\nHe figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.\n\n\nHe came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.\n\n\nThanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now.\n\ntl;dr: boyfriend and I are still together, he's figured out to be alone, things are great.",

It made me feel terrible. I brought it up with her and here's what happened.\n\nI brought up the topic and she was super cool about it. She was surprised and she said that it was just friendship on her side. However, she went up to the guy and asked him if he saw things the same way. He said he didn't -- he was actually into her. So, she told him that she's with me and that they need to stop hanging out. It was never an issue after that -- we still met him at a few parties, but it didn't make me feel bad at all.\n\nReading the old post made me smile. It felt like a big issue back then, but she solved it so swiftly. I'm really thankful to her! We've had the most wonderful relationship since then (and even before then). We're 33 years old now and still going strong together. We moved in together a couple of years ago and it's been amazing living together, traveling together, being together all the time. She's still so sweet, I love her with the bottom of my heart, and it's obvious she loves me too.\n\nYou never know how these things will turn out, but ours is a story to fill your hearts with hope and love!\n\nPS: now I'll delete the password to this throwaway and any reference to it on my computer.

      "body": "Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q10gs/my_20f_friend_21f_is_going_to_great_lengths_to/\n\nSo I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life’s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me.\n\nAfter posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over.\n\n… Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily’s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a ‘home wrecker’. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I’d been cheating on Sam and how I’d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he’d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend’s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn’t in the flat… I was celebrating Sam’s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven’t had any other messages from him since.\n\nEmily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can’t say I saw anything, but I also can’t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I’ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be ‘free’ from our partners but she knew I wouldn’t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own ‘abusive’ relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off.\n\nI didn’t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we’re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I’m breaking my lease, and I’m going to spend the night in a friend’s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I’ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision.\n\nAlso a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn’t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to ‘I know he’s not cheated on me with Emily’, but I do know he didn’t. He never contacted Emily privately, and was really only friendly to her because she was my housemate. Sam was just as unlikely to cheat with Emily as I was with any of his friends, family or housemates. I know some of you may still think that he could still have cheated/cheat in the future and I can’t definitively say he didn’t/won’t, but I’m not going to ruin my relationship with ‘what if’ style thoughts.\n\nTL;DR - Housemate who was trying to prove to me that my boyfriend was cheating was actually cheating on her boyfriend and wanted me to ‘join in’ by convincing me to dump my boyfriend. Found out from her boyfriend, who had been told that I was the one telling her to cheat on him (I wasn’t). I’m moving out as quickly as my legs will let me.",

      "body": "[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cysbos/apparently_im26f_too_perfect_for_someone_like/)\n\nI wasn't going to bother linking the original post but I guess I have to. It only attracted the attention of 2 people, one of them probably has a lot of throaways judging by my karma. Still, it's a happy ending and a teachable moment I would love to share with the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell- I met a guy I liked, found out there was an incident involving him, ran away cause I lost a close friend to a similar situation and that was too much for me to handle. A year or so later I looked him up to see if he even survived, we got back in touch and became friends. Over the years I caught feelings, he started yet another relationship. He went through a hard time and crashed at my place. We kept living together, he got better emotionally and started showering me with affection. Then I got hit by a drunk diver and got off with no complication and very easy recovery (compared to what could've been in that particular situation). While I was in the hospital he told me the incident left him disfigured. He fixed that, it's barely noticeable, you literally have to know about the remaining scar to see it but he can't stop seeing himself that way. Once I left the hospital, those tiny signs of affection got progressively bigger, to the point there wasn't a moment without physical contact. One night we were cuddled up on the couch and I went for the kiss, he shut me down by saying I'm too perfect to be wasted on someone like him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe actual update- The next day I went to work, he pretended last night never happened, I was freaking out cause I wanted to have the talk but didn't want to push it. Had the talk anyway and now we're together. We opened up about a lot of things. He had no idea why I ran away when I found out about the incident. He thought I knew about his injuries and didn't want him like that. I haven't spoken about my friend with anyone but a therapist, I finally told him and he understood. He said he was jumping from relationship to relationship to numb his feeling for me cause he thought I would never be able to love him back. The night I tried to make the move, it was the kiss itself that freaked him out. Turns out that sexy cheeky slightly crooked smile is nerve damage and an ex told him he's the worst kisser in the world. He's not. He's also brilliant in bed. In that one night we became closer than in the past 7 years. And I told him acting like my housewife/babysitter won't fly no more and he toned it down but he still pampers me to an extent. Right now we're like teenagers, glued at the lips, making up for lost time. He was my best friend for so long and I know he's the one for me. This felt like a relationship for months before it even started, now I got the good stuff on top of the perfect partnership we already had. So people, talk to your loved ones ffs! We wasted years beating around the bush, learn from our mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR- Communication is vital. Don't be like us, talk to the people you love, no matter how hard it is. Yes, he was that insecure. We're together now and we're making up for lost time. We will work on our issues together.",

      "body": "[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3i958y/my_26f_fiances_28m_exwife_28f_has_cancer_hes/)\n\nFirst off, thank you all so much for your advice and words of support. I’m sorry that I couldn’t reply to every comment, reply, or PM that I got, but I woke up to a locked post and over 100 unread messages. I promise, I did read through every one of them. Each perspective was incredibly helpful and made me look at the situation in a completely different way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. \n\nI spoke to Max this morning. I told him that as terrible as I feel for Caroline, I don’t want him living over there until February. I suggested that we brainstorm some sort of schedule that allowed him to continue visiting her, even postponing our honeymoon and using that money to fund his plane tickets. Several commenters brought up her moving over here for treatment, so I mentioned that as well, offering up our spare bedroom. I emphasised that I didn’t fault him for wanting to help an old loved one in what could be her final days, but that I couldn’t help but feel marginalised, especially so close to our wedding. \n\nMax didn’t speak very much, just listened while I rambled on. When I couldn’t think of anything else to add, I asked him to please say something. \n\nSo he told me the truth: Caroline was never stage 4. She was stage 2. \n\nHe assured me that the rest of his story is true. Caroline asking him to be with her, the initial surgery being unsuccessful, her chemo treatment plan, etc. But apparently her chances of survival are *far* greater than he led me to believe. \n\nMax said he lied because he felt it was the only way I could understand his need to be with her. He thought that if her situation seemed less dire than literal life-or-death, I wouldn’t agree to him essentially moving across the country for her. \n\nHe admitted to telling her that our wedding had been postponed to next August, giving her the impression that him being away until February would be no problem. He has also been the one insisting on remaining by her side. After her surgery, she had given him permission to return home, saying that it wouldn’t be fair to pressure him into living with her throughout her entire chemo treatment, as much as she would have liked him there. He refused to leave. He told her that I supported this decision fully. \n\nMax swears that he’s not in love with her still, but I just can’t believe that. He lied to my face. Before she visited our apartment back in May, he warned me not to mention her being stage 4 as she was still “extremely sensitive about it.”  And I completely bought into that lie. I trusted him. \n\nHe put his past with her over his future with me. I’ll be spending the next few months apartment hunting and cancelling wedding plans. \n\nThank you all for your kind words. \n\n**tl;dr: Confronted fiance. He misrepresented his ex-wife’s illness so that he could spend time with her. It’s over.**\n\n*Edit:* I'm blown away by the outpouring of support I'm receiving. I wish I could respond to each of you individually. Thank you so, so much. This is a wonderful community, and I truly appreciate all of your thoughts.",

I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it.\n\nHe said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side.\n\nHe can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying \"my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore\" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text \"Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s\\*\\*t\". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like \"what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you\" \"I think you're misunderstanding\" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though.\n\nI could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her.\n\nSafe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was \"I WON!!!\" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations.\n\nThanks for the helpful advice everyone.\n\nTLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great. Thanks to everyone for the great advice.",

We have a 7 month old daughter.\n\nIn the past, we have normally resolved arguments by taking a few hours to cool off and discussing. However, this situation is different and I don't know what to do.\n\nWe flew back from his parent's house the day before yesterday. While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said \"do NOT say those things in front of MY child.\" It was loud enough that people were staring and I was really embarrassed.\n\nThen we got home and I put the baby to bed and then he tried to initiate sex with me. I told him I wasn't in the mood after what happened at the airport, and he lost it and said I shouldn't put sex in his head by calling him sexy and then not have sex with him. I told him I would've be up for sex had he not snapped at me! He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. I tried calling him and just got a text back that said he wants space to cool off so he \"doesn't do something he'll regret.\" I told him to come home NOW as I've been alone with the baby for 2 days and it's New Years but he won't.\n\nShould I give him space or give him an ultimatum?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the comments. A lot has happened since I posted this and the situation is being resolved. I'll post an update when I can. Happy and healthy new year to you all.",

      "body": "The front page r/askreddit thread inspired me to follow up here. [Here's my original post from five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fnzui/me_35_m_with_my_sister_42_f_siblings_for_35_years/).\n\nThe discussion was really helpful, and at one point I had my therapist read that thread. Thanks to everyone who chimed in. \n\nSince that post, I have not been in contact with my sister, except for incidentally at a few family events, where we had minimal interaction. My other family is conflicted, but they seem to understand that neither of us wants to be in each others' lives any more, despite them wanting us both in theirs.\n\nI've worked on this issue specifically in therapy, which has helped me develop some insight into those messages. Next year I will be as old as my sister was when she wrote me those abusive messages (there were a few followup messages I didn't include in the original post.)\n\nI don't regret cutting her out. I do regret having had a toxic person for a sibling. Looking back I recognized that her over the top email was part of a few lifelong behavioral patterns. I realized that basically, despite our biological similarities and having been raised in the same household, we are simply not compatible people.\n\nI hope one day she will develop her own insight, recognize her abusive behavior patterns, and reach out to try to repair or reestablish a relationship with me. But I'm not holding my breath for this to happen, and I'm not interested in reaching out to ask her if she'll consider trying to improve things. Not having her in my life in the years since has actually improved the quality of my life: there's been a lot of unnecessary drama and hard feelings that I'd been used to having to handle that I simply don't with her gone.\n\nAt this point I anticipate only seeing her at a few more funerals. Would have been nice to have a good relationship with a sibling, but I do not have that with her and I don't believe I ever will.\n\n**tl;dr**: Cut abusive person out and life has improved\n\nEDIT: I am humbled by your responses. Your support has moved me to grateful tears. Your perspectives, today and years ago, have really helped me to power through a pretty difficult experience. Thank you very much.",

In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me.\n\nSo what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.\n\nNow, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time.\n\nOh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;)\n\n**TL;DR** he cheated and it sucked, but not really because he was an awful partner in hindsight. new man much better and my life is more fulfilled :)",

Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to /r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha. \n\nI got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of **Alexis.** Not women in general.\n\nI got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish. \n\nA clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a \"hey, guess who dropped by\" situation.\n\nAnyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there.\n\nIn the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there \"not even Brooke.\" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes. \n\nI got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with \"Dude, what the fuck.\" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious.  In his words: \"I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some.\" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever.  Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything.  Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom \"Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then.\" Imagining that moment was kind of funny.  Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously.  During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.  \n\nWhen we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in.  I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate.  He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over. \n\nThis week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute.  As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying \"Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution.\"  I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it. \n\nLater that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to.  She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day.  She said she felt guilty that she \"led him on\" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???)  She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (\"not rape, but..idk I never said yes either\") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on.  She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to \"make it right\" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by:\n\n* Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again\n\n* Give me full access to her phone and passwords.  She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times.\n\n* Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?) \n\n* Makeup sex whenever I wanted\n\nYeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer.  I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from \"our song\") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying \"She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL\" \n\nIn happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said \"First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it.\" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful. \n\nAs for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it. \n\nSo that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with.  Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them. \n\nAgain, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support. \n\nI fucking love you guys. \n\n---   \n**TL;DR**: Brooke is kicking Alexis out and Derek is still my buddy. I'm doing okay given the circumstances, and I'll hopefully be finding a new apartment next month.",

      "title": "[UPDATE] I [22M] suspect something between my girlfriend [22F] and my friend [21M]. We all live together. Am I imagining things?",
      "body": "A lot of you requested an update to my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/).\n\nThe majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act.  I decided on doing both.\n\nSunday night everyone was back in the apartment.  I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused.\n\nThe next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore.  In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't. \n\nWhen I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back.  I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking.  Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there.\n\nShe was fucking Mark.  I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us (**not** the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said \"Nice. Real fucking nice.\" and bolted back to my car.\n\nI heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was *How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them?* My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch. \n\nI'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop.  She started off asking me to come home so she could explain.  Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was *good, you earned it*. There was a pause and then she sent \"I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out.\" I waited. She sent \"Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me.\" No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something.\n\nI received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure.  He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year. \n\nI don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture.  I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend *and* friends.\n\nAny advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her. \n\n**EDIT:** I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan. \n\n---   \n**TL;DR** She was cheating, but it wasn't with Derek. I'm shattered.",

      "body": "My original post can be found here; [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u9c5i/me_24f_with_my_so_27m_of_1_year_he_destroyed_a/) and the tl;dr is; \n\n*tl;dr: Boyfriend burned a candle my deceased sister made for me because we were without power. We have a surplus of candles that he completely ignored. Can/should I forgive him for this? If so, how?*\n\nA few people have PM'd me in recent days asking for an update so here it goes. \n\nMy original post was the day before Thanksgiving. Eugene and I had planned to spend Thanksgiving with my parents but that did not end up happening. \n\nOn my way home from work, I stopped at a local craft store to pick up supplies to make a new memorial candle for Carrie. Thank you /u/70ms for the amazing, heartfelt suggestion. My parents and I spend a day remembering Carrie and making a new candle using some of the wax from the original candle. I also ended up purchasing a locket and having some of the remaining wax from the candle put inside and the locket welded shut by a friend. \n\nOn the evening of my post, I got home and Eugene said he wanted to talk. I agreed we needed to clear the air before Thanksgiving so we sat in the living room and started to talk. I was not ready for what he told me.\n\nA few commentors from my original post seemed to hit the nail on the head in a way. Eugene told me that when we first met, he was extremely turned on by the fact that I was essentially a damsel in distress. I just lost my sister recently, I was in a massive depression, I wasn't myself. And that turned him on both sexually and in a \"protective\" way. \n\nOver the past few months, I've started to become more myself. I got promoted at my job, I've joined a cooking class and have gotten out more, and I've definitely moved away from being a damsel in distress in the eyes of Eugene. \n\nHe went on to explain that he burned the candle in hopes that it would throw me back into that phase because that is the only time he felt he was attracted to me. That's right, he is not attracted to me unless I'm upset, crying, and a damsel in distress. When I prodded for more information, he told me that every one prior to me that he had dated had either just experienced a loss or was \"in need of rescuing\". \n\nEugene told me he was no longer attracted to me. He dreaded having sex with me because he could no longer be the \"hero\" that was rescuing me which is what turned him on in the first place. He didn't like go in public with me because I had started to put myself together more (like not just wearing a t-shirt and jeans like I did when depressed) and that attracted the stares of other men that he saw as a threat (taking away his damsel in distress). Eugene had a whole laundry list of things he hated doing now because I wasn't in a funk anymore.\n\nI told him if that was the case then we needed to break up. He agreed and said he would go stay with a friend until he could make new living arrangements. My name is the only one on our house and I told him I would give him 60 days to vacate the house which he agreed was fair. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I've spent a lot of time with my parents and with close friends. I don't really feel like I've been dumped, or broke up with someone. I just feel like me. \n\nCarrie's candle sits on my desk where the original was and I wear the locket every day. Thank you Reddit for listening. I appreciate it more than you know. \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Ex only likes damsels in distress. We broke up. I'm happy.",

Link to original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70q1an/my_29m_former_fwb_25f_claims_to_be_pregnant_feel/\n\nOriginal tl;dr: Former FWB who lives in a different country says she's pregnant and keeping the kid. Don't know what to do. Advice please.\n\nAt the time, lots of you saw many red flags that I didn't and you were pretty sure she wasn't actually pregnant. You were right, she wasn't! After telling her I'd only continue talking to her when there was a paternity test, she initially agreed. She then made up more stories about hospital visits, problems with the pregnancy and got angry that I wasn't being supportive. I held my ground and told her I wouldn't communicate further until the paternity test was done.\n\nAbout a week later, she finally admitted it - it had all been a lie to get my attention. I sent her a message asking her to get help and never contact me again. Blocked her everywhere.\n\nThat was over a year ago, and I've had occasional messages (from other numbers) since then, either asking for forgiveness or getting angry with me for not offering forgiveness. I generally ignored them, though she did get in my head once by sending a message that she was so worried she'd damaged me and I replied telling her that I'd moved on and forgave her. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, she text saying she was visiting the city I live in and wanted to meet up for a chat. I ignored it and blocked the number. Didn't think much of it.\n\nThen, 1 month ago, while I was on holiday, the receptionist at my work sent me a text. Someone had enrolled in a course in the where I teach who was asking about me. 27-year-old Russian. Holy shit, it was her! I had to tell my manager the story and she agreed to me taking some extra holiday and working remotely to avoid any unpleasant situation. \n\nI received a few texts from her, telling me she had enrolled in that school by coincidence (no chance) and finally one to 'congratulate me on avoiding my idea of hell'. Her course finished last week and I found out from some social media stalking that she's now in another city. I think (hope!) that's the end of the story.\n\nThanks for the help reddit.\n\ntl;dr My ex wasn't pregnant. One year later she travelled to my city and enrolled in a course to try to see me. I managed to avoid her and it seems like it's finally over.",

I’m happy to say he was an absolute gem and dinner at my mom’s was great. We played some games and ate a lot, then Alan drove me to my late husband’s family’s dinner and dropped me off.\n\nI said hello to everyone and had a small plate (so much food!) then left after about an hour. My MIL was so happy to see me, and even though it was hard — she pulled me aside and cried a bit — I’m glad I went.\n\nWhile I visited, Alan drove around a local park and played Pokémon Go, haha. So he was happy when he came back to get me and he had hatched a few eggs in the meantime. The next day we got our Christmas tree.\n\nCommunication with all parties wins again!

I finally saw him last weekend for the first time in about seven weeks (he invited me over). He seemed happy to see me at first, but things just seemed a little...off. Like we didn't know what to say to each other.\n\nI stayed with him on the Saturday night. Had a shower Sunday morning and the first thing I saw was a bottle of camellia-scented body scrub that was definitely not mine and I can't remember ever seeing it before. He lives alone. INSTANT RED FLAG. Stupidly I didn't confront him about it straight away, I wish I had.\n\nOver the next couple of days I tried to make conversation with him and he either left me on read or sent really short replies. Finally, on Wednesday night I'd had enough - and I'm not proud of how I acted but I was so hurt by the anxiety and the pain of feeling rejected - I blocked him on Facebook without any warning.\n\nThe following afternoon, I got a text message *\"Hey, ummm...so did you block me?\"*\n\nI responded:  \n*I did. I give up. Life's too short to be someone's afterthought.*  \n*Whether you've just lost interest or whether there's somebody else (when you jump in the shower on a Sunday morning and see girly body scrub that isn't yours, you gotta wonder), or both, I really don't care. I deserve better and it's not worth feeling like a dirty little secret and feeling like shit when I could be happy by myself, or go find someone who lifts me up and genuinely wants to be in my life and vice versa. I'm angry at myself for letting this drag out for so long. I should have let go ages ago but I guess I hoped that things would get better. More fool me.*\n\nHaven't heard from him since so I guess the trash took itself out! He clearly didn't care about me at all. I'm 31 tomorrow, looks like I'll be spending it free and single! \n\nTL;DR - saw partner for first time in 7 weeks, things seemed off, found girly body scrub in shower that didn't belong to me, saw red, blocked him on social media.

      "body": "7 years ago when I [17M] was preparing for college at 17 I was trying to find scholarships.  I applied to a scholarship run by a local family using money from a man in the family who was very wealthy. They eventually announced that a girl from our town had won and I thought nothing of it.\n\nMy brother [27M] is now in AA and is \"making amends.\" He admitted to me that I won the contest.  He said that an old teacher of his was on the scholarship board and saw him at the store, and brought it up to him assuming we knew. But we didn't know as the letter hadn't come in the mail yet. But after she said something he knew, and when the letter came he took it.  \n\nHe was mad at me at the time (now he doesn't even remember why) and says that he responded to the letter thanking them but  telling them I had received a full ride scholarship to the school of my choice and no longer needed funding.  He gave them his own cell phone number and said they could call him with any questions.  He says they did and he just convinced them I didn't need the scholarship and they should give it to someone else, so they did.\n\nHe admits it was shitty of him but doesn't seem to think it was a big deal. He doesn't even see the value of the money lost because I still got to go to college, but the difference was that I ended up 40k in debt with student loans.  I still owe 35k and the interest is counting. The scholarship would have paid out a total of 45k over the course of my college education as long as I maintained minimum grades. \n\nHis prank cost me tens of thousands of dollars. I know he's in AA and the goal is to make amends and fix relationships, but this honestly makes me never want to see him again. I spent college SO incredibly stressed over money and this could have solved so much of it, and he did this over something he can't even remember now.\n\nWhere do I go from here? Am I \"supposed to\" let this go?  Sorry this is kind of a rant, I don't really know what I'm asking other than just general advice of how this should affect my relationship with him. I feel like I don't want any relationship with him at all now but I know I might regret that years down the road.\n   \n**tl;dr**:  My brother was mad at me and did something that caused me to lose tens of thousands of dollars. He's admitting it now as part of AA. How do I keep a relationship with him when I've never been more angry with someone in my life? Should I even try?",

      "body": "This sub has really changed my life.  I don't know how to express my gratitude, but hopefully this update will let you all know what you do here really matters.\n\nWhen I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.  \n\nMy mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here.\n\nI needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is.\n\nI started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine.\n\nI opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M.\n\nIt was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed.\n\nMy therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly.\n\nThank you, Reddit.\n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y8b3b/m33_disregards_my_f32_overt_boundaries/\n\nTL,DR: My ex was abusive and I didn't realize it until Reddit made me realize relationships aren't supposed to hurt so much.",

      "body": "This is in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e9op2w/i_25f_asked_my_so_25m_what_i_thought_was_a/) post, which received an overwhelming and surprising response. \n\nAfter the events of the post, I sent my boyfriend an email (after we spoke on the phone and I voiced all my concerns), essentially saying that I loved him but we had different needs. He wrote me a long email back, which was very surprising to me since he doesn't like to show emotion in any way. He said he feels as if he's become a shell of a person and that he would really like to work on things. I agreed to try, vowing to myself that something major had to change.\n\nDuring all this, I bought 'Attached' by Amir Levine (after a few commenters suggested it). It completely changed my outlook. I identified so strongly with the anxious attachment style and I really felt my boyfriend was avoidant. A lot of our problems made sense. I started to work on sorting through those issues individually in therapy. I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often). I even recommended that he read the book. He read the first chapter and immediately agreed that we were anxious/avoidant.\n\nOver a month later, I've felt a growing distance. The future is looming and decisions need to be made. I started doing more without him. Looking at flats alone for once. Yesterday, after weeks of not discussing 'the relationship', I asked him if he felt a disconnect too and he said he did and was glad I said it. We then agreed that it wasn't working and likely never would due to our differences. \n\nI'm pretty devastated. We ended on incredibly good terms and I still think the world of him. It's hard for me to know if I'm doing the right thing or if I expect too much. He's such a stable, solid, kind presence in my life and I feel thoroughly alone. I do realise that I went through this for a reason, it's just hard to remember that right now. It's just very raw at the moment. I'm hoping time heals all wounds and this isn't something I grow to regret. \n\nThank you to everyone for your support on the last post. It's really helped me get through all this so far. I go back and read the comments every time I wonder why I went through with this. \n\ntl;dr I tried to make it work with my boyfriend after realising we have different needs. It didn't work out and we ended civilly. I'm feeling shattered and scared, but hopeful I made the right decision.",

      "body": "[Here is the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lvz0t/my_25f_professor_30m_asked_me_to_go_on_a_date/)\n\nHi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go...\n\nAnyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put \"next month\" in the title but realistically, I should have put \"next week.\" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up.\n\nFirst and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!!\n\nSo I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this:\n\n\"Mark,\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :)\n\nI wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all. \n\nAgain, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. \"\n\n(The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar)\n\nAnyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there.\n\nSaturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon.\n\nWe decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this.\n\nAnyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now.\n\nThanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!\n   \nTLDR: Got a new job, graduated and went on a date with Mark. He's a good kisser. I'm happy.",

I took the advice to be generally supportive of the lGBTQA community without being obvious about it. I also spend some time reading about bisexuality. \n\nI did post a story on June 1 but the best thing that happened was that his friend came out as bi herself. We follow each other on Instagram and she had made a post about it. I made a comment congratulating her and wishing her well. She did text me about a dinner and  while we were   \n chatting she thanked me for my support and this wonderful woman gave me an another opportunity to express my support and do it in more personal way than a comment. \n\nHe came out to me about a week ago. He was very nervous and still scared and all I wanted to do was tell me that I knew but from what I have read letting people do it on their own terms were really important. He told me, nothing would change. He just wanted me to know and he didn't want to hide a part of himself. It was okay. I told him nothing had to change. He was the perfect man for me and I loved him no matter what. \n\nHe did ask me later if I knew and I came clean. I told him I saw. Apologized for it and cried a lot. He was upset but understanding. He even apologized for suddenly changing his behavior which is bullshit as I should have dealt with it a lot more maturely. it just hit just right spot of insecurity for me.\n\nThings are fine. He is happier and we are getting back to our old routines. \n\n TL;DR:  He came out. I confessed to snooping and things are okay.",

I appreciate all the advice that everyone gave. I called the bird brain last night and basically went off on him. He had explained that they previously did have a past many years ago but they had reconnected after his last relationship but it was strictly platonic but THEN...\n\nHe tells me that he has herpes? That's one thing. Then tells me that I should possibly get tested. The last time we were physically together was in May. I confronted him and asked him if he slept with someone and he admitted that he slept with one person (pretty sure there were more). He said it meant nothing and it was only physical and there was nothing emotional about it. I asked why he did it and he said it was more of a \"last hurrah\" before he moved but it was with someone totally random. I asked how you meet someone random and he hesitated and said Tinder.\n\nHearing all of this I didn't know what to say and was in complete shock. He said he was sorry and it didn't mean anything. He said he understood if I wanted to break up but would still want to be friends because \"I'm really important in his life\". I obviously immediately broke up with him but it feels like a huge weight is off of my shoulders. I don't plan on being friends with him either since it shows that he’s trying to have me around in his life, more of a benefit to him. He's a piece of shit and I'm glad he has herpes :)\n\nAnother UPDATE:\nThere were things I needed to get off my chest for my own closure and so I sent him a message saying that I’m not comfortable being friends after everything that he’s done and he’s trying to keep me around and what not. He responded back with a few messages but the one I thought that was hilarious was when he said “I am upset about the whole situation and the prospect of losing you in my life. You are an amazing woman and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I wish you the best and hope down the line, we are able to reconcile.” \n\nI realized with his response, he never apologized for hurting me or about the situation itself and saying HE’S hurt? I’m glad I got out of it sooner then later. I removed him off all my socials as well \n\nThank you everyone for the comments and support. I’ll make an appointment soon to get tested\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: The tool slept with someone else while we were still exclusively together and is a piece of shit",

      "body": "Link to original post: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i4nbdc/my_28f_boyfriend_32m_told_me_a_white_lie_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf \n\nTl;dr: we broke up lol \n\nMy previous post got more attention than expected so I figured I’d update.\n\nWell, it’s over. As many of you suggested, I couldn’t possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically. \n\nI initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his “life”. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly.\n\nFor those of you who were confused about how I didn’t know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like “hey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?”. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn’t have been keen to what I was talking about anyway.\n\nIt got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I’m pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough.\n\nI’m sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don’t even care. I’ve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I’m killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works. \n\nI want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you’re getting. I’m so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I’ve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I’m a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you’re not as worthless as someone made you feel. \n\nThanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don’t look back.",

She told me she had wanted to tell me for a while, but didn't know where to start-- that she thought about Sam everyday but at the same time didn't know how to begin.\n\nShe pulled out a shoe box from her closet and she showed me the pictures. Pictures of her wedding, this propped up little thing at the courthouse, her in a short white dress with a slight stomach. Her husband, this cocky smiled kid with this shaggy blond hair. \n\nThen the baby, Sam. Pictures from a red-faced baby to this little four year old person. Birthdays, and Christmases, and pictures of the three of them- a family.\n\nShe talked about Brendan. How they came from these radically different backgrounds and she barely knew him as a person before he was a father and husband. They'd only been dating three months when she got pregnant. They were twenty.\n\nThen she talked about Sam- her baby. She kept saying he was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hearing that broke my heart. She talked about how his hair cow licked in three different spots and how he was always singing or humming, that he loved to climb. She told me his favorite movie and book. She made him a person to me. \n\nThen she told me how they lost him. Some kid ran a red light and then he was gone. She barely remembers the funeral because she was so heavily medicated. But the worst part was after, going home and him not being there- how she'd walk past his room and expect to hear him playing, waking up and forgetting for a minute he was gone. \n\nTheir marriage had never been good and they turned on each other. He blamed her because she had fastened the booster seat on that side of the car. She blamed him because he had been driving. They were divorced within a year after the accident. Brendan had a new child within two.\n\nShe had spent the time doing overload on classes and working, keeping busy because it made things easier.She didn't see her old friends because they drifted away- they never knew what to say. And they mostly had kids of their own. She was surviving. But seeing Sam's brother who looked so much like Sam hurt so much that she decided she had to get away and stop wallowing. She took the pictures down, donated clothes and toys, deleted her fb and stopped seeing the old friends who weren't really friends anymore. She said she chose to keep breathing because that was what it had come down to. Then she met me.. and she said I made her want a fresh start- a better marriage and more children- because she loved me.\n\nWe talked for hours, she cried and I cried for her. \n\n I still love her maybe more now because I feel like she opened up to me so much. it's hard to imagine her married, with a son, toys on the floor, and pictures on the fridge. it's hard because in a lot of ways it's the life I've been imagining with her.\n\nI still plan on marrying this woman. She's the love of my life. \n\ntl;dr She told me about her past. I love her and understand why she didn't tell me.",

I, obviously, was not too excited to be having to schedule my Valentine’s Day weekend around this dog’s needs, but was willing to do so to have a weekend alone with my boyfriend.\n\nWell, much to my surprise, the dog is a total sweetheart! When her owner is not around, she barely raises her voice, sleeps most of the day, and is extremely easy to care for! It would appear that it is really stuff like the incessant baby talking that *actually* bothers me, not the dog itself.\n\nThrough observation, as well, I’ve realized that the dog only barks and whines because she knows she’ll get attention or food *from her owner* whenever she wants. My boyfriend has very cleverly trained the dog to know that that doesn’t work on anyone else. So no begging from us!\n\nSo now I ignore the roommate’s dealings with the dog, love the dog herself, and let my boyfriend’s roommate deal with the worst parts of owning an old dog and just enjoy a buddy to watch tv with when shes not around.\n\nWin win! Thank you everyone for all the great advice.\n\nTL/DR: Dog doesn’t suck! Roommate still sucks at raising the dog but its much easier to ignore now because the dog is so great!",

Sorry for not responding in that thread, real life's been a whirlwind lately, yay someone at the office testing positive for covid.\n\nLong story short, I did as redditors suggested and did a zoom call with my big sister, ostensibly to catch up but really to get a handle on how things have changed.\n\nMy sister was actually really great and supportive about my lifestyle changes. She apologized immediately for the 'jokes' when she saw how much weight I'd lost and was super supportive about me not drinking anymore and coming out of the closet. She is not the problem, at all.\n\nThe problem is our parents. From what my sister said, my mom especially has been steadily alienating everyone in the family. When I left, she found a new target in my little brother. When he joined the military and left, she started going after my cousins. My big sister, the one who's having the wedding, has always been my mom's favorite, but she says that she's opened her eyes to how my mom treats people and is planning to move away herself after the wedding (our parents are paying for most of it).\n\nI've agreed with my sister that I'm not coming to the wedding. We agreed that it would give mom a new target to make a huge scene over, and there will be an open bar at the wedding when I don't trust myself to be around that kind of thing. \n\nWe're now planning for my sister and husband to come visit me in my new city sometime after the wedding. \n\nThank you for all the advice and support!\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: zoom called big sister, she's great, I'm not going to the wedding but my sister will visit later",

      "body": "One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.\n\nIt's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.\n\nA year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.\n\nEver since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.\n\nThe wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.\n\nI feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.\n\nThe trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.\n\nNow when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.\n\nI'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.\n\nI've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.\n\nI've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.\n\nI do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.\n\nBut I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?\n\nEdit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.\n\nEdit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!\n\nI have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.\n\nOpinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.\n\nIn terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.\n\nIt does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.\n\nIt's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.\n\nI will post an update of what happens, thank you again!\n\nTL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed.",

      "body": "Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8efmq2/my_22f_former_roommate_30m_is_freaking_me_out/\n\nNo one asked for an update, but I thought I'd provide a short one.\n\n**TL;DR: I never have to see John again in my entire life. David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.**\n\nShortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates.\n\nIt's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate.\n\nA few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago.\n\nWe broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not \"rock the boat\". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again.\n\nAnyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction.\n\n**EDIT:** I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. \"David\", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. \"John\" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything.\n\n**EDIT 2: Seriously, this response is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your support and well-wishes. I hope all of my future coming-outs go this well. <3**",

      "body": "So I didn't automatically dump my boyfriend. I decided I'd have a talk with him, I told him that it was basically really damn inappropriate to find out I have money and start making demands. I told him I have no problems using my finances for our relationship but that he shouldn't automatically expect that I'm going to put out money on very expensive things for him, just because. He seemed very ashamed and agreed that it was a really crappy thing to do and he got carried away and a bit too excited. I told him I understood but to do that was very disrespectful to me and the time we've shared together because it made me feel like all of a sudden my money is what mattered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a little while it seemed all was well, then the other day we were having a minor argument over something that turned into a bigger argument and he said something along the lines of well you don't even want to use what you have for us so maybe you've never fucking cared about me. He got really quiet as though he knew that was a shitty thing to say and we didn't talk until 2 days later. I was really angry, I was going to talk things through with him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever this came the relationship fatality. He told a couple people we're good with, despite me asking him to keep the money quiet, that I was really rich and could afford tons of shit. How did I find out, Saturday we all went drinking together, he gets a bit too much in his system and orders an expensive bottle of wine, one of our friends was like who orders that shit, we're good with our beers and that's too expensive. Our other friend piped up and was like no it's good /u/FamilyHeiress is really rich, she can pick up our tab tonight, cue several other people who I've never told about my family's money suddenly grilling me on why I never trusted them enough to tell them about my money and oh, thought we were friends that kind of thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI broke up with him the next day. He's been blowing up my phone all day but fuck him, I could have moved past what he said the other day when we were arguing but to tell people I specifically asked him not to something I trusted him so much with. Yeah, I've lost a 3 year relationship and am probably going to lose a few friends as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr talked to my bf, he said he'd make an effort, he didn't, told some of our friends that I was wealthy, they were shocked I didn't trust them with this, I dumped him, may lose some friends soon as well\n\n\nEdit: for everyone asking the bottle was 460\n\n\n\n\nOP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j5fnj/boyfriend_28m_found_out_how_much_money_i_28f_have/",

      "body": "Original post for anyone interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d864x4/not\\_sure\\_if\\_im\\_27\\_overreacting\\_to\\_bfs\\_30\\_joking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d864x4/not_sure_if_im_27_overreacting_to_bfs_30_joking/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spoke to my bf the day after I responded to a lot of you. I decided I was going to talk to him one more time and set a boundary about these 'jokes' or tell him I wasn't moving in with him and that maybe we need to reevaluate the relationship. I told him I wanted to have a serious discussion and he immediately asked if I wanted to break up with him because he figured it was coming. I was taken back because I didn't expect that reaction. I didn't say anything at first, but then I told him that I wanted to talk to him about his jokes and, honestly, his behavior in general when it comes to people and making fun of them in such a mean way, especially when they ask him to stop. I also did a little reading on verbal abuse and abuse in general and things were a lot more clear. \n\nSo, he listened to me and then told me that he didn't like people trying to \"change him\" and that his last girlfriend had tried to do the same and she couldn't accept him for who he was; he thought I would be different because I was more understanding and fun. I'll admit, that is probably one of my flaws, that I try to understand everyone's position about most things and give them far too many chances, there are exceptions, but for the most part, I will try to understand someone and work with them on it. I asked him if she, his ex, and the overweight friend were the only ones who had left him over this behavior and he told me that he'd lost a lot of friends and dating was hard because women tended to cut out pretty quickly, again, in his words, because people are too sensitive and want him to change how he is. He seemed very stuck on being accepted as he is and angry about people trying to change him. I changed direction and asked him if he actually thought anything was wrong with what he said, I used my experiences, specifically, and told him about how I felt when we were looking at places and he said what he said to the potential landlords. He, of course, said they were jokes and that he'd never think less of me because of how much money I made because he kind of figured I didn't make a lot because of how I tended to do things. I asked him to elaborate and he said how I was always on things like Groupon or using coupons at stores or wanting to go out when places had specials or something and he was never around anyone who needed to do that type of thing. So, I told him that I did think he has a problem with people who earn less and don't live a similar lifestyle to him and that, maybe, he just didn't see it. That, sometimes, we are trying to be \"good\" because we have these thoughts of how we should be on the surface and we try to follow them, but when it's more close to home, our real feelings come out because we're faced with it more and I told him that was okay, but that I didn't think it would work for us, that he might be more comfortable with someone who makes the same amount as him and can contribute how he'd like. He interrupted me and told me he didn't want someone like that because he couldn't be himself around someone obsessed with money and material things (not what I said, btw); that they'd be too concerned with money and he liked me because I wasn't that way. I kind of ignored that, but it kind of told me that he either doesn't want someone who has as much \"power\" in the relationship as he has or he thinks women who want more/expect more of him are gold diggers or someone trying to take advantage in some way, I don't know. Anyway, I continued and told him that even if he felt they were just jokes, they were wearing on me and my self esteem and I couldn't live that way. I also told him that it's natural for people to not want to change when they've been a certain way for a long time and so it seems right to us, but that change can be good; that maybe therapy could be good at helping with that. I told him that it's wonderful to be accepted for who you are, but if who you are is, well, jerk-ish, people are a lot less likely to accept you unless they are also jerks and nothing good can come from a bunch of jerks getting together because they'll be toxic to other people, as well as to each other, and I told him I think he's better than that, that he deserves much better. That any woman he truly loves deserves much better than being verbally abused and made to feel like they aren't his equal or worthy.\n\nHe sat there and didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me and sighed a lot. He finally said he was disappointed in me for wanting to abandon him because he thought we were true soulmates and he couldn't believe I was saying such abusive stuff about him. I was shocked he was calling me abusive because I didn't think I was being abusive by telling him why I don't want to continue if this is how he will act and that the way he acts is not, well, good. Maybe I went a little far in saying anything about a future girlfriend, but I guess I wanted to impress on him that, if his friends and partners keep leaving because of this behavior, everyone will keep leaving. The only partners willing to stay will be someone who dishes it just as well as they take it, and he knows he's actually very sensitive and wouldn't like that or it'll be someone who lacks any self esteem and he'll make her feel even worse about herself until she breaks down. Like, I could feel myself getting to that point and that's why I'm so angry and frustrated. Not only with the fact that he was now turning all this around to me being abusive, but that he still didn't really seem to get what I was saying about my feelings; it made me realize, yes, I need to leave this situation and I do feel bad about it because I do feel like I'm abandoning him, but at the same time, it just doesn't seem like my feelings or anyone's, are important to him, so why should I stay with someone who doesn't seem to get that his behavior isn't exactly such that gets people to stay in his life? I realized I probably wasn't going to get to him and the conversation itself had me shaking because I was upset and disappointed, myself. However, looking back, I could see signs that this is who he is, other people's feelings just don't mean a lot to him and doing some soul searching, I realize that I, stupidly, thought he would change over time, but waiting on that is wearing on me and our last conversation tells me that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he does, so it's unlikely he will change. \n\nHe didn't seem interested in saying anything else besides that he was sorry I felt the way I did. I told him that I thought we needed to give up on things and find someone better for ourselves elsewhere. He didn't say anything, so I just left. A few hours later I got a confusing text from him telling me that he \"hadn't seen who I was and that I had abusive tendencies\". I didn't respond and just blocked him on everything. I'm sad things ended the way they did, but it was probably for the best. I'll either be good alone or I'll find someone who I work better with. And I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and sorry if I didn't get back to anyone. I've been quite torn up over this, even though it was my decision. I miss him more as a friend than a partner, but I don't think being friends would work out too well, either, so I'm just leaving it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Tried to have a talk with my bf, didn't go well, so we broke up. Oh well.",

And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked \"is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!\" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. \n\nWe are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was \"Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname\"\n\nSo I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. \n\nI also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. \n\nI hope you guys all have a great week!\n\n\nTl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!\n\n\n**Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a \"sick fuck\" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**\n\n\n**And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments.

      "body": "[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aiyf0c/i_23f_have_always_had_intense_toxic_relationships/)\n\nA few months ago I wrote about dating an actually stable guy after only having toxic relationships. The post got more traction than I expected so I figured it might be nice to do an update. Thank you so much to everyone who replied to my post, all the replies really helped. \n\nAs it turns out, the guy I was seeing found the Reddit post, clicked that it was me, and talked to me about it. Turns out he actually felt the same way in terms of low intensity but he liked that, and I decided to keep dating him for as long as we kept having fun together. \n\nWell, I’m happy to say that last week we celebrated being together for six months, and that we are quite madly in love with each other :) \n\nAfter we talked I took the advice of some of the commenters and tried to just enjoy my time with him instead of worrying about the depth of my feelings. I soon realised that he’s a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person and we totally get each other. He makes me laugh with the most inane stuff and he thinks my dumb jokes are funny too. We can talk for hours and hours about anything at all and I rarely feel like I have to justify or explain my point of view at all - he just understands me. One of the first times I knew I was really falling in love, we were chatting in bed, and suddenly it was 3 in the morning and I realised we’d been chatting for three hours without a single awkward pause. I’ve rarely had that with anyone else, and never with a previous boyfriend. \n\nI think most of the commenters were right. My other longest relationships were all built around toxic intensity and wild passion, and while this relationship definitely isn’t lacking in the bedroom, I’d say it’s much more built on a sort of close friendship and respect for each other. It’s certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I’ve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. I feel like I have not just someone to go out with or to cuddle up to, but a genuine life partner - somebody who supports me, who I can talk to about anything, someone who makes me want to be a better person. It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away. I really just needed time to get used to dating someone who doesn’t play games and displays his affection openly and frequently. \n\nWe did have some slight issues with communication to start with - mainly me being afraid to bring issues up/suggest things because of other boyfriends overreacting terribly in the past - but after we talked a lot he’s been very supportive and proven himself to be a mature enough adult that he can handle occasional criticism without getting super defensive. It’s been really refreshing to be in such a drama-free relationship where we can argue or talk about issues in a really healthy way. \n\nThank you to everyone who replied - you all helped a lot and I’m really glad I took your advice and didn’t just break up with him. I love him a lot and I can see us being together a long time. Thanks :) \n\n**TL;DR:** Turns out I just needed to adjust to a healthy relationship. Boyfriend is great and we love each other a lot. Everything is awesome, basically.",

I've been asked multiple times for an update, but it's been super busy, and I actually have a little time today, so I thought I would update everybody on my situation.\n\nMy ex made a doctor's appointment for a couple of days after my last post. She sent me a text with the date and time, and asked me if I would be going with her; I told her that I wouldn't but that I wanted Emily to go with her. She straight up refused and said this was \"our baby\" and that if I didn't go, she would cancel the appointment and wait until I was ready to go. We argued for a little bit until I gave in. I told her that I would meet her there, and I would stay for the entire thing, but I was going to be stone silent the whole time unless the doctor asked me a question.\n\nHer appointment was at 9.15 that morning, I showed up at 9.10 and sat across from her in the waiting room. The doctor called her back a couple of minutes later. They talked for a couple of minutes, she asked her some questions, and then she had her go to the restroom to pee in a cup (I made sure that her purse and everything stayed in the room - somebody warned me she would be crazy enough to buy a pregnant woman's pee and use that instead). After she gave the cup to the doctor, the doctor left and then she tried to talk to me. I sat there and ignored her and texted my friends until the doctor came back and confirmed that she was pregnant. I started shaking and tried to control my breathing, but my ex was so excited, and the doctor was excited with her. Then came the ultrasound, and my ex was roughly 11 weeks pregnant. After a couple of minutes, I excused myself and left. I texted her as I was leaving that before anything else happens, we're having a paternity test.\n\nFirst off, Noninvasive Prenatal Testing is super expensive. I told her that I would pay for half, but that if the child wasn't mine, then she would have to pay me back for that. She told me that her parents were willing to pay for it. Her parents have more money than I would know what to do with. Like... millionaries money. I told her that my ex-roommate was taking the test as well. She said that he didn't need to and I snapped saying that, \"I guess I can wait another 6 months. Because they won't put my name on the birth certificate until they prove I'm the father.\" She finally agreed with me and made him take the test as well.\n\nThere's a place around here that actually specializes in DNA testing, so we were able to get in just a couple days later. SHE BROUGHT HER MOM WITH HER! They told us that they would have the results in 10 days and that we could come pick them up or they could mail them to us, we said we would pick them up in person.\n\nI was too nervous to go to the results. Emily and Trevor both went in place for me. According to them, my ex wasn't happy that I wasn't there and almost refused to let them see the results, but her mom told her that she could understand why I didn't want to be there.\n\nI'll never forget that phone call from Emily\n\nE (Emily): Hey!\n\nM (Me): Well...?\n\nE: You're not the dad! You should have seen the look on your ex-roommate's face though! **He's the dad, I didn't make this clear. Sorry!**\n\n*At this point I squealed like a little girl.*\n\nMy ex attempted to text me later and I just ignored all of them. Both of her parents did text me though saying that they wish me well with teaching. That really meant a lot to me.\n\nAs for other things in my personal life... I've gotten a new apartment over by Trevor and Emily. My ex doesn't know where I live at the moment, her number is blocked, she's blocked on facebook, and everything else that I could think of to block her on.\n\nI've joined a summer baseball league and I play for that 2 times a week. I'm volunteering in the preschool classrooms on campus in the mornings. My job is giving me more hours (requested). I'm taking 3 summer classes, and I'm the ASL tutor for the summer classes now that they have started. I also bought a bike, and now I ride that daily as well. I also got a kitty. His name is Jasper. And I read a lot more now. I realize that I wasn't reading as much as I normally did while I was with my ex, but I've gotten back to reading!\n\nMy friends are saying that I'm too busy now and that I have even less time than I did when I was with my ex. I like that. The busier I stay, the less I think about her, and the happier I am. There's a week between the summer classes that I'm tutoring this summer, and Emily, Trevor, Emily's best friend and I are going on a 5 day hiking/camping trip.\n\nI want to say thank you for everybody that helped me through this. The support that you've all given me has really helped me. There are still the people that are saying \"This isn't true\", but I'm receiving a lot more positive support than negative.\n\nNo, Emily and I are not going to date. For the many people that have asked, I'm sorry to disappoint you and say that we're not. I don't see her in a romantic way, and I plan on staying single for a while.\n\nI'll be finishing up my BS in Elementary Education this upcoming school year, and then I still need to decide whether to continue schooling and pursue my MS in Deaf Education and Deaf Studies, or whether I should start teaching.\n\n**I'm sorry, I had to take the link down of Jasper. I was reminded that you are not allowed to post links.**\n   \n**tl;dr: She is pregnant! But I'm NOT THE DAD! Now to move on with my life**",

      "body": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am3mwy/my_25_m_boyfriends_26_m_anxiety_comes_out/). \n\nI'd like to begin by thanking everyone who left some input; I was overwhelmed by the response. Just know that I did read every single comment.\n\nIt hasn't been very long at all; I know that. And I truly don't know what the future holds. But here's what has happened in the past ten days or so. \n\nI admit, I should have talked to Charlie earlier before heading \"to bed\" again, but I was embarrassed about broaching the subject and still ruminating over the advice. \n\nAnd so, his anxiety flared again during sexy time that night. Rather than immediately falling into comforting him, I began asking him why he was feeling like he was and resisting the instinct to \"make it all better.\"\n\nIt was a little more tough love than I've ever been with him (and we haven't been together all that long), but it got him to open up. \n\nI did flat-out tell him (in a nice way) that this was getting in the way, that we had to solve this sooner rather than later, and that I didn't like him accusing me of being untruthful in-bed. \n\nAnd he responded to that, apologized, and agreed that we could not go on like this.\n\nWhat actually started coming up as we talked were some things I hadn't considered. \n\nHe was tired at the end of work, distracted by stresses from earlier in the day, finding it challenging both physically and mentally to stay focused and creating this self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of being distracted and unable to be a satisfying partner was doing just that.\n\nHe was also very embarrassed to not be in the mood sometimes, and I do think that was tied in to the \"failure\" mindset. If he didn't feel like getting going, he was failing me as a partner. I asked him to be open with that.\n\nI also told him that we didn't have to go all the way every time if there were other ways to enjoy the moment. \n\nAnd then on to concrete solutions. \n\nLong story short, Charlie and I have spent the last ten days or so just relaxing together at night and reserving early mornings for intimacy (thanks, /u/NerdWithoutACause). Less stress, less fatigue, and it's been a rather amazing physical solution.\n\nNo anxiety flares yet on this revised schedule, when we can do it first-thing and not be under the stress of a long day. But time will tell if this will keep up, I suppose.\n\nCharlie did have therapy three days ago, and he allowed me to look at the notebook he had brought with him. \n\nHe'd brought this all up, and there were some more \"in the moment\" solutions for when his anxiety flared. He's been very open about making the greater effort to control his symptoms on his own without relying exclusively on me.\n\nWaking up to him this morning, he also rather bashfully told me he was feeling under the weather and would prefer if we just cuddled. So we did. And other PG-13 stuff eventually came. It was nice, and I think I have hope.\n\ntl;dr: Resolved to stop comforting boyfriend in bed when his anxiety flared, and realized that outside stressors were part of his flares. We do it in the morning now when there are less of those stressors, and he's working harder in therapy and being more vocal about what he's feeling in the moment. I'm a happy camper for now.",

      "body": "Original post summary: I have been in an exclusive relationship with (called “L” in post) for over 3 years, but we didn’t use titles (bf/gf). Friend (“K” in post) that knows the history of our relationship asked me to “step aside” so he could try to date L.\n\n[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckqgjc/repost_my_20m_friends_22m_wants_me_to_step_aside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nI wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my post and update anyone who might be interested in the outcome.\n\nI have been staying with L for about a week now, since the initial confrontation with K and thanks to people here, I was sure I wanted to ask her if she wanted to make things more official. She ended up making things even easier for me, as luck would have it. L asked me if it might make things easier if I just told K that she was my girlfriend. I jumped on that opportunity and asked if I could tell everyone she is my girlfriend, and she said yes! She and I are going to look at a few apartments this week, since I obviously need a new living situation, and we want to move in together.\n\nK and I had a few brief discussions after he told me he wanted to be with L. I had told her everything K had said to me, and she was not the least bit interested in him, which I had assumed. I also told him that she is officially my girlfriend now, so that should satisfy his concerns about me not committing to her. He refused to believe any of it without confirmation from her, in person, without me around. She initially agreed to meet with him on Sunday, with the plan that they would meet at her house (since she lives with her mom and stepdad), but he rejected that, saying he wanted to meet at the apartment, without me there. She told him she wasn’t comfortable with that, if he wanted to meet up without me or her parents there they at least had to be somewhere public. He got pissed that his threatening behavior made her feel threatened and went on a tirade, called her every name in the book. She told him she wasn’t going to see him again at all and blocked his number. He has tried reaching out to me a few times ranging from sad to aggressive, and I’m about a text or 2 away from blocking him as well. Hopefully he’ll just move on and it won’t come to that.\nAgain, thank you to the posters who helped me navigate this situation!\n\nTL;DR- L is now officially my girlfriend and we are going to move in together. K made unreasonable requests when L agreed to discuss their friendship, then blew up at her, so she ended up blocking him.\n\nEDIT:  To clarify, we both wish him well, but neither of us want to continue a friendship with him under any circumstances. Since posting this I have also blocked him. I agree with posters that there is no point in keeping any lines of communication open anymore. I have also reached out to some friends to help get the rest of my stuff out, but I was already able to get everything important when I first left. He can make a shrine out of my old shirts if he really wants.",

      "body": "When I was about 9 years old, I realized my mom was having an affair for years on my military dad.  I did not say anything as I was really worried what would happen if I said anything. When I was about 12 years old, I found my dad looking at pictures of our family and tearing up and I couldn't take it and I told him about moms affair. Fastforward 5 years and I live full time with dad and his new wife and step sister and our lives have improved so much since leaving mom. \n\nWell grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that \"I am his grand daughter\". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know...\n\nWell my dad has resisted this for years and saying it doesn't matter. But now things have changed as I have half sibling on the way. I am totally happy and fine with this, but for some reason my dad has started to change his mind about the paternity dna test thing. He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling.\n\nI am not sure how much money my grandpa has, but he does have a big house and a lot of property so I guess it's important.

They wanted my brother. \n\nMy father stayed married and my mother took off with my brother leaving me with friends as a toddler. She says it was because I was ugly. Father informed but not interested when I went into foster care and I stayed there until I found out who they were at 18. I've read the court papers as to my foster care.  They just didn't want me. My childhood was horrific. My father maintained contact with my mother and brother. \n\nI have always lived 30 minutes away at most from my birth parents in the same area. \n\nMy grandmother was coincidentally my neighbour. She found out who I was through gossip and would send photos of me growing to my birth parents as a joke. She knew about the abuse and did nothing. She's dead. \n\nI left 'home' at 17 was homeless and have done everything myself. My full and half siblings from both sides have been well looked after by my parents. \n\nAt 18+ I reached out to them and my father was remarried and made plans to see me repeatedly he never showed up for. He said it would upset his new family.  My mother had a lot more children and had forgotten about me really. I contacted them when I had my son and that was it and I heard nothing back.  \n\nUNTIL. I've been in the media a fair bit and my friends have told me that my parents have been bragging about me and taking credit for how I look and my successes.  My mother's side of the story is now that I was cruelly ripped from her breast and forced into foster care. She compares herself to the irish homes of unwed mothers and forced adoptions. Oh WOE IS HER. My father is now an example of the injustice of the court system against fathers and how this is just further proof!  Oh WOE IS HIM. \n\nThey talk about how I look like so and so and that I wouldn't be here without them. That my nieces and nephews Ive never met are 'just like me' and how I should give them the same opportunities I have had in my career. How that's what we do for 'family'. How I need to 'grow up' and get past it. \n\nI blocked contact after they wanted things, but this nonsense spreads easily and I am sick of being whispered about.  I don't want anything off them, I want to be left alone. They want me to meet their other grandkids at parties and they've apologised for the govt/family/god possibly/ the great spaghetti monster keeping us apart.\n\nIf I contact them it is further fuel for the fire. If I don't stand up for myself I look heartless and cruel. \n\nI don't want to leave just yet as my son is finishing school soon, I just want them to stop. \n\nAny advice?\n\ntl:dr parents terrible taking advantage of my successes how to stop them.",

      "body": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mrah04/my_girlfriend_wants_to_take_a_stressful_job_and_i/)\n\nI (27M) would like to thank everyone who took time to give me valuable advice, it helped me realize I was going about it the wrong way and possibly ruined a relationship of 7 years . Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created.\n\nI think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind.\n\nI think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses.\n\nShe really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company.\n\nI have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out.\n\nTl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money. We made a plan to fix it.",

I read a few books and I did some introspection. I have always liked girls. In hindsight, it is pretty obvious why I hated seeing my best friend with her boyfriend. haha. I brushed those feelings aside as just jealousy for how good their relationship was. Teenage me was pretty dumb.\n\nI also realized that my roommate was probably asexual. I have know her for a long time and she has not dated one single person. Never brought a person home. It made me feel hopeless about my feelings for her.\n\nI came out to her about a month ago. I had left one of my books laying around and she handed it back to me. I made a bad joke. I ended up explaining that I think I am bi. It was pretty awkward. She told me she was into girls but she thinks she is a demisexual and it takes her lot to form the emotional bond needed to be ready to have sex. I probably made a mess of the conversation. I thought there was no way she would for such bond with me.\n\nShe ended up asking me out while we were cooking dinner last week. I was pretty surprised honestly. It is scary and a bit awkward moving from being roommates to girlfriend. Scary as hell but even with all the uncertainty about if we could work. I feel incredibly comfortable around her. I can be myself and I know she won't judge me and she loves it.\n\nTLDR: I came out. she asked me out. starting a new relationship.",

So this wasn’t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. \n\nThe evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said “baby, there anything I can do to be better for you?”. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said “idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we’re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.” He seemed a little fake surprised and was like “really? Oh I didn’t know I did it so much and so obviously.” I didn’t want to push the agenda so much because I know he’s a thinker and will think about it even if we don’t discuss it further.\n\nThe next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he’s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven’t seen any overt staring at both men and women.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.\n\nTLDR managed to speak to my bf about this issue and I’ve seen effort from him dealing with him",

      "body": "Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5r6a2g/am_i_30f_overreacting_to_my_husbands_34m_words/?st=JKLZ5SJH&sh=61d0d355\n\nI just wanted to come back and update and say, all of you were right. I should have left that night. Not too long after posting that, the emotional abuse finally turned physical. I was held hostage in my home for over an hour while I was assaulted, demeaned, and scared for my life. I left that night. \n\nIt was a hard road. I’ve questioned myself, my sanity, and sometimes even whether I did the right thing. Emotional abuse took a huge toll on my psyche and self-worth. \n\nI am happy to say, though, that life has drastically improved for the better. I bought a new home for my kids and I. We’ve got a sweet dog and two precious kitties. My son just started 2nd grade and really enjoyed his first day. Everything is falling into place. I feel horrible for what I put them through, and I know there will probably be rough patches ahead, but we are infinitely better off than where we were. \n\nIf you read my original post and it resonates for you, please take the advice of the commenters. Get. Out. Leave. No one deserves that sort of treatment, and it’s only going to get worse. \n\nTLDR; emotional abuse turned physical as many commenters feared, and I feel lucky to be alive. Emotional abuse is not a joke. But we’re all doing well now, and life is looking up :)",

      "title": "UPDATE - Is my (24F) mother (56F) overreacting about me wanting to spend Christmas as a newlywed with just my husband (27M), or am I in the wrong?",
      "body": "Original TL;DR - It’s always been my new husband and I’s plan to spend our first Christmas Day just us - my mother initially had no issues, but recently has become annoyed about the situation and is suggesting that we’re alienating ourselves and no longer see ourselves as part of the family owing to this and our previous decision to elope. Who is in the right?\n\nOriginal post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a88m1g/is\\_my\\_24f\\_mother\\_56f\\_overreacting\\_about\\_me/).\n\nSo Christmas has been and gone, and there was a bit more drama than I wanted. After my original post I contacted my mother to reaffirm to her the reasons we wanted to spend Christmas Day itself on our own, and she said that she understood, and said she looked forward to seeing us on Boxing Day. However, a few hours later I got a call from my father asking why my mother was crying and saying that I’d rung her up screaming and shouting about her interfering with our life. I said that nothing like that happened, and that it hurt that she was accusing me of that when I was just trying to be mature about the situation. My father sympathised, and said he’d try to talk to her about it.\n\nI checked in frequently in the days up to Christmas, but my mother read and ignored my messages. Whenever I spoke to my father he said that she was telling him I hadn’t been in contact and she was waiting for me to apologise, but he had seen that I was in her call and text history. He advised that visiting on Boxing Day might not be the best idea, but if it got to that stage he would visit us alone since none of this was our doing.\n\nWe had our own private Christmas Day, during which we found out that I was pregnant! We had started trying for our first child in secret a few months ago, but didn’t suspect anything until I felt sick at the smell of turkey! We’re going to keep this our little secret for the next few weeks at least with everyone, my husband’s family included. I texted my mother to wish her a Happy Christmas in the morning, and sent another text in the evening asking if she still wanted us to go up to visit tomorrow - I got a one word reply, ‘no’. We took my mother at her word and we didn’t visit the following day - I think she was expecting me to grovel at her feet begging for forgiveness, but that’s not going to happen anymore. I called my father and told him that she had decided that we weren’t visiting and it definitely wasn’t on our end. He visited in the afternoon and brought the dog, and we all went for a walk instead of worry about what my mother was doing or saying to other people about it. Apparently a horde of her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things, but I’m done worrying about what my mother says. I’m not at this stage going to completely cut her off or say she can’t see her future grandchild, but our relationship is definitely strained.  \n\n\nTL;DR - Mother tried to act like I was cutting her out when in reality she shut down and ignored me before telling me not to visit on the expected day. Had our own Christmas, and unexpectedly found out we were expecting our first child instead of sitting through an awkward day.",

      "body": "I'm not sure how I ended up in this horrible place in my life but I guess it's because I believed what I wanted to believe rather than what was obviously right in front of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say he's 100% my type and I've always been gaga over him. When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me \"*if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually*\". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as \"fat\". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does \"lust\" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: husband has never been \"into\" me and I'm unsure if I should continue the marriage.",

She still kinda acts the same (kinda moody but can hold it in so much better now) but its a lot better.

      "body": "I placed my son up for adoption almost 16 years ago. It was a decision I came to on my own but it did come with the added pressure of my mom specifically telling me I would no longer be her daughter if I choose to keep my baby. This was huge for me because I am an only child. It was the most difficult thing to do and I struggle with the emotions of it daily. \n\nIt was an open adoption and I have the ability to reach out and get pictures/updates whenever I like. I did that for a few years but then it just became easier to move on by not knowing. I knew I had made the right decision and the family taking my son was amazing. \n\nI also ended up not speaking to my mother for six years after because of the way she treated me during my pregnancy. It took years of therapy and a lot of forgiveness to even be in the same room as her. I made peace with her for the sake of the rest of our family (i.e. cousins, aunts, grandma's).   \n\n\nAt the same time my mothers health was deteriorating and I found out through some family she wasn't working, had divorced her second husband and was homeless living in her car.  \n\nI had moved away and was doing well enough financially. I succumbed to the guilt provided by my family and agreed to move her in with me and help her get the proper care. It wasn't ideal but I made it work. Got her healthy and got her into some housing and our relationship has been ok. \n\nFast forward to July of 2018. I had lost my job, and in general things weren't working in my favor. Mid-life crisis status but with all things I knew this too would pass and a year from now this would not matter.  I had a plan of action and knew things would get better I just needed time. \n\nThings did get better, got a new job, moved to a new city, celebrated my birthday and on vacation until January 2nd. Things were great up until this morning. \n\nI'm visiting out of town with some family, which includes my mother. My mom approached me about having issues with her computer/phone I paid for/bought and asked if I could help. \n\nShe handed them over and I started troubleshooting. As I'm going through I notice her computer has several tabs open and I start closing things and un-cluttering the mess. Next thing I see is an open email from August between the man who adopted my child and my mother. She is basically telling him how bad my life is because of her and her health issues and I lost my job and she needs to speak with him to ask for any kind of help. The last email is them exchanging phone numbers. \n\n\nI'm beyond upset now and don't even know what to do or say going forward. I've locked myself in the bedroom and trying to wrap my head around this. Thanks for reading.\n\ntl;dr: mom went behind my back and contacted the family who adopted my son telling them how poorly I'm doing in life (which is not true) asking for money.",

      "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oqcoa/18_m_my_parents_found_out_i_have_a_girlfriend_18/\n\nMy parents recently gave me an ultimatum - break up with my girlfriend or face them turning their backs on me, prompting me to drop out of university. They are very conservative and religious (Christians) and they said I should only date when I'm done with school.\n\nGrowing up I wasn't allowed to date at all. Prior my first girlfriend, I had only kissed one girl. My parents have always been very strict and unrelenting in what they think is right and what they think is wrong. Sex before marriage for them is an absolute no no. I come from Kenya but studying for my BA in England. \n\nMy parents found out I had a girlfriend due to Facebook - yeah, I learned from that mistake, big time - and they flipped. My dad called me and told me to break it off, or else they would stop paying for my BA and I'd be forced to drop out and come home.\n\nInitially, my plan was just to lie them - they are thousands of miles of away and with me being much more savvy with FB privacy settings in the aftermath of what happened, the chances of them finding out I was still with my girl were slim. However, that didn't come to pass because I got very pissed off by what my dad demanded of me.\n\nHe required \" physical proof\" that the relationship was over. Over the weekend, he called and demanded that my girlfriend should record a video of herself, saying it was over. \n\nI'm a shy, reserved person who has always been obedient to my parents. But for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself. I've never spoken back to my parents before but on that day, I did. I told my dad that he wasn't living in the same universe as everyone else and that there was no way I would humiliate and degrade my girlfriend in such a manner. That such a proposal was insane. He then started screaming and shouting at me (characteristically so). I cut the line. He tried calling again - I answered and he continued shouting. I told him I wouldn't talk to him until he started acting in a civil manner. I hung up again and didn't respond to his calls.\n\nHe then sent me a string of angry messages, saying he will stop paying for my tuition and that I'm not his son anymore. My mum called me a few hours later and she imitated my dad's angry rhetoric. But I calmed her down and we spoke. I told her that I absolutely love her and my dad, and that I'm grateful for everything they have done for me in life. \n\nBut I stressed the fact that I'm 18, I'm a man living in a completely new country, absorbing a completely new culture and making my own way in life. And that I'm old enough to have a girlfriend. I told her my girlfriend makes me happier than I've ever been, that she got me out of isolating myself in my room during those first weeks, when I was too shy to meet new people and make new friends. She continued to object, and went to the extreme justification of her reservations - pregnancy. Going so far as asking whether we had slept together! I told her that respectfully, it's none of her business. \n\nAfter that she hung up on me. I didn't hear from my parents until yesterday. It was my mum. She said she and my dad will continue paying for my tuition, but that they are very disappointed in me and  they regret sending me off to Europe to study - that it was better for me to go to a Kenyan uni. She added they raised me to be a better man and that the path I'm going down isn't right.\n\nI was planning to go to Kenya for the Christmas break but with the way things are, I don't think I will. My older sister lives in Seattle and she said I'm welcome to stay with her over the Christmas break. But that will probably be too expensive of a proposition for me. My girlfriend is Norwegian and she said she would love it if I spent Christmas with her and her family back in Norway. Her parents would be cool with it. Norway is a much more realistic destination for me. It's much closer than the States and thus much cheaper.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I kinda feel bad. I mean I'm happy that I stood up to them and it was such a relief. However, some of the things my parents wrote and said kinda stung. Was I wrong in my approach with them? And how should I approach them regarding our relationship, in the future?",

Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.\n\nI've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.\n\nThe more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.\n\nTo be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him \"I wish I'd had a dad like you\" and he said \"I wish you did too.\" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.\n\nIt's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.\n\nTL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?\n\nEDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him. Thank you all again for so many comments and advice and ideas!",

      "title": "[Update] Single father [38M] with my daughter [17F], discovered she has a large amount of cash and I'm suspicious.",
      "body": "I was signed into this account on my laptop and noticed I received PMs asking for an update to my [post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2or7bz/single_father_38m_with_daughter_17f_discovered/). So, here it is. \n\nI had a long talk with my daughter Sarah that night. I sat her down and described the circumstances of the discovery. I explained that I was worried because it's a large sum of money and I didn't want her savings to be stolen. \n\nWell, turns out the elderly neighbor, Anne, has been giving her cash for the better part of a year now. Anne wanted her to have the money to help with college expenses, and told Sarah to keep it a secret from me because I've always refused to accept money from her. Sarah also told me that part of the money was her own. She had been saving up for my birthday present and didn't want to put it in the savings account because, well, she'd have to ask me and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. \n\nLater in the conversation, I brought up the expensive clothing. Those were throwaways from her friend's mother. Her friend is really tall so she couldn't wear them and gave them to Sarah instead. They needed some slight alterations so she hasn't worn them yet. I apologized for snooping and explained that as a father, I was obviously concerned for her well-being. I also assured her that we are financially stable and that I've put aside enough money for her college expenses. I told her to keep an eye out for Anne, to make sure that her welfare is not affected by the money she's paying Sarah. Also, I asked her to write a thank-you card to her friend's mom and to include a present for her at Christmas this year.  \n\nAfter the revelations, I wanted to reward her for her savings habit, so I offered to start a checking account for her and we looked into the options online. Turns out, the bank I use offers a junior checking which I can co-sign (overdraft fees, etc) for her. It turns into her own personal account at 18. She'll have the use of a debit card, the bank also offers an online-based financial planning guide, so she will read that before starting the account. We're going to the local branch to set that up for her this weekend.\n\nSarah seemed to reflect well to our talk. She took the opportunity to reveal that she has been in a relationship for a couple of months. I've actually met her girlfriend a few times before, they go to the same school and I just thought they were good friends so that was a surprise. So yes, she came out of the closet to me. \n\nBeing a dad, I still verified the clothing story with her friend's mom. Overall, I'm happy it was just me dramatically overreacting. However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess. \n\nP/S: I didn't reduce her allowance but did encourage her to keep saving because it's an excellent habit. \n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Money from neighbor, clothes from friend's mom, so she's getting her own checking account. She also disclosed she's in a relationship. Worst of all, my tortured soul is left wondering what she's buying for my birthday.",

      "body": "I [F27] moved into my flat in October of last year to take the place of a mutual friend of mine and my new flatmate [F27]. We have a generally great atmosphere in the flat, and both have similar expectations and habits and while we're not 'friends' yet (as in we wouldn't go out for brunch or be each others plus ones for parties) we are very friendly. She seems super normal and level.\n\nWhen the lockdown began (March), my boyfriend [M31] of two years was living with his sister, and his mother (undergoing chemo) who lived alone, needed somewhere to stay where she could be looked after, so she moved into his room and he came to stay with us. My flatmate was totally fine, and we had a proper chat about ground rules etc, but ultimately the flat is huge for two people and she has a kind of granny flat set up in hers. Either way, she gave definite approval. \n\nNow, we three got on great, but never really spent a tonne of time together. We all work from home and spend the occasional evening playing games or whatever, but ultimately we didn't mingle much more than before. My boyfriend, however, cooks every night for the both of us, as a thank you, and so we do now eat together, and my flatmate seemed happy to be included.\n\nIt was great. However, last week, my boyfriend took me aside and told me that while he was in the courtyard hanging out the washing she \"ambushed\" him from behind and gave a huge speech about how she's in love with him, and while she \"respects\" he's with me, she has deep feelings for him, and that she's available if he were single. Oh, and please don't tell OP. She didn't try to kiss him, but tried to hold his hand.... \n\nHe was very anxious and flustered when he was telling me this. The flat atmosphere is VERY awkward now, but as far as she knows, he's not said a word. She's not said anything else to him, but he did mention that she had touched his arm a couple of times as she was walking past recently and it's really gotten under my skin. My BF is also confused because he hasn't spent that much time with her apart from dinner, and never alone. \n\nI spoke to our mutual friend who was shocked, and says she's never done anything like this before, and she'd never known my housemate to have a crush on anyone either. I've not seen her acting strangely in any other ways, and it hasn't outwardly affected how she treats me. We can't move rn because: virus, money etc. How do I deal with this? \n\nTL;DR: my flat mate has told my boyfriend she loves him while he's staying with us, and we can't leave.\n\n(note: edited for typo)",

      "body": "My daughter died three weeks ago. My wife and I are obviously upset but we're coping. I'm posting this because I'm a little worried about her boyfriend. I've been back to her grave three times and he's been there every time. Just sitting there. The first two times I left, because I didn't want to bother him, but yesterday I went over and talked to him. We went to a bar and talked some more.\n\nI'm not going to pretend to know the guy, I had only talked to him 5 or 6 times prior to this. But he seems like the type of guy who keeps to himself, with not too many friends. He's also a bit of a nerd. He reminds me of myself actually, which is part of the reason I feel the need to help in some way. When we were at the bar he said a few somewhat alarming things , but these two stuck out: \"she was all I had... I have nothing left\" and \"I'm lost without her.\"\n\nI suggested therapy, told him that it's helped me in the past, but he had no interest in it. I offered to let him stay at my house, I can't imagine its very nice sleeping in the apartment that she died in, but he declined. I'm not really sure what to do. He said things that made me think he might commit suicide, but I don't know him that well so I can't be sure. He just seemed so gloomy. Advice is appreciated.\n   \n**tl;dr**:Daughter [F20] died.

      "body": "Hey guys,\n\nIt has been about 4 months since I made my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9641hl/my_36f_boyfriend_50m_cancelled_our_holiday_and/) so I thought I would update.\n\nTL:DR - We broke up.\n\nAfter he returned home from his (our?) holiday, I tried to raise some of the issues that were pointed out to my by people who commented on my original post, which all boiled down to a reality that basically our relationship is really only a relationship to me and that for him I am just providing the \"girlfriend experience\" without being able to expect or enjoy any kind of commitment. \n\nHe defended his actions and did manage to generate a pretty impressive list of ways he has been there for me over the past 4 years. But as I learned from you wise people, he is really only there for me when it is on his terms, and when he is being \"so sweet\" it is likely an act, whereas the rest of the time he is just being himself. \n\nWe broke up a couple of weeks after he returned home. I will admit that it was devastating for me and I really had to go through a grief process for the loss of how I hoped things might turn out. Until about a week ago, he would not leave me alone. He left me daily gifts at my home (actually inside of my home until I made him give me back my key). He recruited my friends to do little surprises for me, knowing I hadn't had the heart to tell people about our break up at that point. It was humiliating. When it was my birthday, he sent a lavish gift based on a sexy inside joke of ours. He came to my work place (he is a consultant there, I am on the payroll) and acted as though we are together, making me cry in the bathroom at how awkward it was because I hadn't told my colleagues about our split at that point. And worse of all, I took myself to a hot country to have a solo vacation - all \"sister doing it for herself\" - and he had the nerve to JOIN ME at the place I was staying after he found out about it from others. When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me. He ruined a vacation I really needed, and I embarrassed myself crying many tears in a beautiful, tropical paradise surrounded by people in love, or at least that's how it seemed.\n\nI realize how horrible he sounds when I write all of this out, but we did have many good years together, including a lot of fun doing a shared hobby that not a lot of people are into and that is super time consuming. I'm not sure how to face him in our mutual spaces anymore. I don't know what switched off for him to finally give me space, but it has helped immensely for me to heal and get over this without him lurking around or love-bombing me to try to get me to change my mind. After the vacation fiasco, I know that he is only reaching out because he misses the convenience I brought to his life, not because he misses me or cares about me, or he never would have done such a rude, selfish thing.\n\nI am posting mainly as a thank you to those of you who took the time to reach out and share your perspectives with me, both gently and not-so-gently. I am not sure how I was recruited into allowing him to treat me that way, and I'm working with a very fantastic therapist to learn more about who I am in relationships. It will be hard to spend the holidays without him and I miss his kids a lot, but it is such a good feeling to know that I have a fresh start. I've been enjoying the holiday parties with family and friends this year, and have met a couple of really cute men who are close in my age, seem emotionally available, and are immersed in interesting, creative careers. They flirt with me like I'm a real person - you know, talking and asking questions instead of just compliments and being taken to events like the token \"I got dumped by my wife but check out this hot babe who loves me\" type of girlfriend. I'm being careful and oh so slow, but guys, oh so hopeful too.\n\nI am very grateful for your help. I hope you have a lovely holiday and a wonderful new year. \n\nSigned, \nRecovering Plaything",

We had one great blowout. When I told him he needs to cancel his trip, he told me to “fuck off“ and “he needs to do this for himself“. I told him I plan to fuck off. Still denying seeing the woman this weekend.\n\n-Miscellaneous shit: found a receipt thatincluded a new box of condoms, then found condoms. We don’t use condoms. He still talks to the other woman daily, and is currently helping her with her resume. \n\n-I told him I’m done, etc., and he’s looking for an apartment.\n\n-He left for Denver this morning.

      "body": "[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lk3bta/my_coworker_45m_often_interjects_his_opinion_on/)\n\nHello, thank you all for the comments!! I know it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post. Some of y'all offered some great advice...again, thank you. So here's what happened since my last post. \n\nI went back to work the next day and Jack was off...it was blissful. I didn't see him the rest of the week because he went back to Montana to see some family. I only knew his whereabouts because another coworker felt the need to inform me... \n\nAnywho, Jack gets back that weekend and on Monday he runs into me as we clock in. Immediately he begins to describe Montana...his sister was getting married in a small wedding...the colors...the flowers. I express my congratulations to his sister and start heading to my department. We don't see each other until lunch break.\n\nI'm sitting down enjoying my leftovers when Jack comes over and starts in on what he has in mind for my wedding, even so far as mentioning price brackets. I put up my hand and tell him to stop. I tell him that my fiancé and I are doing a courthouse wedding, it may not be romantic in his eyes, but it's what we want to do and what we are looking forward to doing. I also told him that he needs to drop the subject as we are not changing our minds.\n\nHe starts apologizing and saying that he didn't realize that I was serious about the courthouse. I just shook my head and told Jack again to stop talking about it before I walked away from him.\n\nYesterday I heard from another coworker that Jack was upset and didn't mean to cross lines with me. At this point I don't care. I said my piece and am super happy that I stood my ground. I will keep doing this too because it feels good to not be a doormat. I should've done this sooner! Thank you again. \n\n**tl;dr**: Jack went on vacation, came back, and started his usual spiel. I stood my ground and it felt pretty damn good.",

      "title": "I've [F25] returned from a month long trip and my roommate [F22] has moved all her things into my room and has been living there, with no intention of switching back.",
      "body": "Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do.\n\nSo I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met \"Lana\" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this).\n\nOur flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.\n\nBecause of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say \"this would be *your* room\".\n\nWe moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.\n\nJust over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.\n\nI came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled \"what the fuck?\" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.\n\nI walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said \"Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it.\" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said \"And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point.\" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said \"We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back\" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.\n\nI've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as \"okay let's swap now you're home.\"\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?\n\nEDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say \"Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)\" (Yes I'm petty.)\n\nI'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.\n\nEDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.\n\n**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**\n\n**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a \"coffee\" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**\n\n**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold \"hi\" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted \"did you do it!?\" and I said \"what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course.\" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**\n\n**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**\n\n**She burst into tears and said \"Omg he's going to kill me\" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the \"what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah\" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like \"ring me in the next five minutes or we're over\" \"send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work\", just abusive stuff.**\n\n**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**\n\n**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**\n\n**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming\" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him\" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**\n\n**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**",

      "body": "Sorry if this is poorly written I have never used Reddit before, I was discussing the situation with my son \\[not one of those who lives with me\\] and he suggested making this post. I have always been an introverted man, my ideal night is a quiet one in-front of the tv with my wife. I loved raising my 3 kids and was sad to see them go when they left but was also happy that they was living their own lives and I could enjoy the piece and quiet that I hadn't had for a long time. All of my children are married now, my eldest (32M) is living a successful life with his wife and children. But my daughter quickly lost her job and couldn't find a new one and relied on her husband's (31M) wages but had 3 children (6F, 5M, 3F) despite it not really being financially viable. They fell behind on rent and couldn't support themselves so they all moved in with my wife and I. Then my other son and his wife (26F) had 2 children (4M, 1F) and they made a lot of financially bad decisions including buying an expensive car from a unreliable person. It turns out the car was stolen and it was taken by the authorities and my son lost a lot of money on it. They too couldn't keep up with bills and looking after their children so moved in with us. My wife welcomed them with open arms.\n\nMy wife enjoys the quiet life like me but she is also more of an extrovert and she loves having the kids and grand-kids around. But this is a nightmare, I thought my days of being a parent and running after kids was over but it feels like I am doing it now more than ever. I shouldn't have too put up with this at my age I have done my job as a parent and I shouldn't have to do it again. I get no peace at all I can't read a book for 5 mins without being interrupted by a screaming child. It's horrible having 11 people crammed into one house, granted it's a big house but still. Even going to toilet is such a pain because I always have to wait for multiple of my family members to go first. What's really annoying is that everyone else seems very happy with this arrangement. I know they are all looking for jobs but I don't particularly see them putting in maximum effort to find somewhere else to stay. I am really reaching the end of my tether and when i tried to talk to my wife about it she was appalled with me saying that you don't stop being a parent once your kids move out and I should help them in their time of need. I sort of feel like she is right but at the same time I just can't stand this anymore. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR- My grown up kids, their partners and their children have all moved in with me and my wife. Ruining my ideal quiet life",

      "body": "Original post: https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fp32i/i_27m_think_my_fiancee_27f_might_be_cheating/\n\nFirst off, I wanted to thank everybody who commented on my original post. Most of you guys wanted me to call the number Sandra was constantly texting and I honestly was about to. She came home an hour after I had posted the original post. I was almost asleep by then and I guess she thought I was asleep. She took out her phone and unlocked it. I saw her password. \n\nEventually she fell asleep and I unlocked her phone and searched the number on her phone. The number belonged to some guy named Jeff and the text messages were extremely sexual. Some examples:\n\nFrom Jeff: I loved the way you bounce when we fuck.\n\nFrom Sandra: I love it when you go down on me.\n\nThose were just 2 examples of the sexts between them, but there was a hell of a lot more. I screenshotted a ton of them and sent them to myself. \n\nAt this point, I was done with her. I confirmed that she was cheating on me. So I decide to snoop some more and looked through her photos. They were a couple of photos of her kissing and cuddling with some guy, who I assume is the same guy she's been cheating on me with. Of course I also send those photos to myself. But what threw me over the edge was a video of her (I assume one of her friends were recording this) giving some guy head. I almost lost it and woke her up to confront her, but I calmed down. Of course, I also sent the video to myself. \n\nAt this point I went for a walk for nearly 2 hours. Mind you this is the middle of the night and the area I walked through isn't the safest of areas. Still, I didn't care. I was so angry.\n\nEventually I calmed down enough and went back to our place. I slept for maybe 3 hours and woke up. I printed off some of the sexts and photos and waited for her to get up.\n\nShe finally got up at about 6AM. When she finished eating breakfast I slammed the text messages on the table. She looked at me with horror. She started crying and shaking. I took the engagement ring from our dresser and walked out. \n\nI came back a couple of hours later and she wasn't there. I called my landlord and told him we wouldn't be renewing our lease. I told her I was moving out and to never contact me again. I packed all my shit and moved in with a friend.\n\nSo yeah that's it. She was cheating on me and I'm done with her. She's been blowing up my phone begging for a 2nd chance, but she's not getting one.\n\n**tl;dr**: Sandra is a cheating bitch. She can go fuck herself.",

      "title": "[UPDATE] I[24M] caught my sister[26F] trying to steal a watch of mine, and now my mother[51F] wants me to apologize to her.",
      "body": "So its been a few days and I thought I'd update my original post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fkk4p/i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a_watch/\n\nI invited my mom to lunch so that we could discuss what happened at the party and where to go from there. I explained to her that my sister stole a very expensive watch from me. It wasn't just some trinket, and it shouldn't matter even if it was. I tried to pull her away and confront her in private, but she chose to yell and curse at me and cause a scene. I also told her that I understand it is never okay to look into someones private purse or bag, but that sort of etiquette goes out the window when tens of thousands of dollars of my stolen property is in her purse. \nMy mom then went on a long rant about how we are all family and that her and my sister believe that a family should share in each other's success. She tole me that my sister was just upset because I was \"hoarding\" all of my money for myself and that it's understandable what she did. She said that I would never gotten where I am today without all the work she put into raising me and the influence her and my sister had on my life. Then she went on to tell me that I \"owe\" it to her to evenly share my success with her and my sister since we are family and they would certainly do the same in my position(that's a laugh) \nAt this point I'm pretty dumbfounded. Not only because she thinks my sister's actions were somehow justified, but because she credits herself for my success and thinks it's selfish of me not to share with her and my sister. And don't even get me started on her trying to act like her and my sister would do the same. I know for a fact my sister wouldn't give me a dime if I were 10 cents shorts for a heart transplant. And my mom still owes me tens of thousands of dollars that she borrowed and swore she would pay back(I don't expect it back and wrote it off as soon as I gave it to her) \nI just can't even fathom how my mom could actually think like that. At that point I was so furious and didn't want to say anything I'd regret, so I got up and walked out. Oh yeah, I also got a text half an hour later saying that I owed her money for lunch since I was the one who invited her. Despite the fact that neither of us had even ordered before I left.\n\nAs far as my sister goes, I haven't contacted her and she hasn't contacted me. At this point I'm just done with her in my life. I don't know if I should do the same for my mother though. I would hate to not have a relationship with her, but I just can't believe how she could possibly think those things. Would love some advice on what to do as far as my relationship with my mother goes. Thanks. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: \nHad lunch to talk with my mom about what happened.\nShe claimed that my sister was justified in what she did because she was upset that I wasn't sharing my money with her.\nTold me that we are a family and should share in each other's success and that I am being selfish by not doing so. \nI got up and walked out\n\n\nEND OF TLDR.  I thought that putting edit/update in front of the newly added parts would make it clear, but I keep letting angry complaints about how the TLDR is so long. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Small update I thought I'd post. She called me but I didn't want to talk so I let it go to voicemail. She left a voice mail telling me to check my email. Here is her email: \"First of all, it was very rude of you to walk out on me at the cafe. I was humiliated and you should know better than to treat your mother like that. As I said in the text, you owe me money for lunch since you were the one who invited me so please bring $60 to give to me at Craig's BBQ. It is a shame that I even need to be telling you this, I know I raised you better than that. But you really need to start supporting this family. We are all one, and the success of any individual needs to be spread around the family. Your sister works as a pastry chef and is always more than happy to bake for everyone and bring us treats from work, I wish you would do the same. You can start out by helping me with the new apartment I'm moving to. The rent is $4250 per month(not including utilities) I am planning on moving in around the first of September so that gives you plenty of time to set up some sort of monthly bank transfer. I'm going to need $8500 in about 2 weeks for the first and last months rent. I'll also need you to come over a few times this month to help move my stuff over there. Bring the bigger truck, unless that's the manual because Tod doesn't know how to drive stick. As a thanks for moving my things over there I will cover the security deposit myself so you don't even need to worry about it. \nAnd you still haven't apologized to (sisters name) so please get that done this week. It will take 5 minutes tops so just get it done. It was wrong to humiliate her like that and guess you had to be the one comforting her. Me! Like usual. \nText me to confirm that you got everything and let me know how soon you can bring the big truck over.\n\nI should also mention that I currently pay for her rent. After some long guilt trip about how she gave me free food and housing for 18 years so it's time for me to repay the favor. I can clearly see now that that was a big mistake. Now she just assumes I'm going to pay her rent at some new huge place that costs twice as much and that she doesn't need? At this point I'm done giving her any support, she clearly as no appreciation for it. \n\n\nThat's just a taste of how my mom acts. She is extremely entitled and just expects everything in life to be given to her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Another update. So I just sent my mom an email letting her know that I will not being giving her any more money.Here's the gist of it:\n\n\"I will not be paying the rent for the new more expensive apartment you want to move in. Not only will I not be paying for that, but I won't be paying your rent for any apartment anymore. You will have to do that yourself. In addition to that, I will not be giving you *any* money whatsoever. You have shown that you have no respect for me or the work it takes to earn money and I cannot continue to pay for things you don't need. I know this means cutting back a bit, but there is no reason for you to be living outside your means and I won't subsidize your expensive lifestyle.\"\nI wrote it all out completely different, but that's the gist of what I told her.\n\nSo just waiting for the freakout I'm sure is going to happen.",

I am forever grateful for both my step sister and step mom cause we all just had a group hug on her couch while I bawled my eyes out. It ended and we didn't open presents but just talked. We had brunch and it went well tho I was holding in tears for the whole thing, this was the first time I could see they actually do care for me and I care for them.

This was the first time I ever felt like a full family unit and not the bad kid who fought with my step mom was just wasn't the nicest to my step sister. I thank them so much for not holding a grudge when I went through my teen rebel phase. I hugged them both goodbye and went home, I feel like me giving them a shot and going to my dad's place helped me realize that these are the people who have always been there for me. I mean they were the ones who didn't give up on me when I was a troubled teen and I love them both for it. I talk with my step sister almost daily now even if its just a good morning text and I call my step mom a bit too now.\n\nThank you all for the comments and making me realize that I should go and how it would do wonders to make us all closer it helped!\n\nTL;DR: went to my step mom's place for christmas and we all bonded more than I thought",

      "body": "I’m kind of in shock right now. I decided yesterday to end my 9 month relationship...we have been arguing constantly recently and it was turning toxic. It had got to the point where my bf said his mom has overheard our arguments and he said she thinks I treat him like shit. (Im not sure if this is entirely true as his mom has always been absolutely lovely to me) Regardless i was so mortified to hear that, embarrassed and ashamed,  so I said that is a prime example of why we shouldn’t be together. He said it didn’t matter what anyone else thinks and he wanted to work through things. In my mind though things had gone too far and we needed to split.\n\nI told him in person yesterday when I was at his house that we needed to break up , that the arguing was too much and it wasn’t good for either of us . Id brought his belongings that he’d left at mine and I tried to be as nice as possible. He turned on me and said “no way, you’re not doing this to me you fucking idiot. How dare you come round here with the intention of breaking up? Are you mental? Are you sick in the head?” He called me the most disgusting names. \n\nI said I needed to leave and I was sorry but he locked the front door and wouldn’t let me go. It was only us two in the house at the time. I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn’t. Instead he started to interrogate me about the reasons I wanted to leave. Kept wanting to know if I’d met someone else and was I leaving him for another guy. I couldn’t get to my cell phone as it was in my purse out of reach so I couldn’t call anyone for help. Then he changed tactic and said  we can work things out, backtracked on the thing he said about his mom, said he loved me and didn’t want to break up. In order to keep myself safe I kept him sweet and I agreed to stay together; he had calmed right down by then and I felt relieved. \n\nLong story short I’m still with him. He said he wants to come to see me later and make things up to me. He said he will buy us takeout and we will have a nice evening together. I don’t know why he is so intent on wanting to stay in such an awful relationship. He tells me I’m a complete pain in the ass all the time and how he’s had enough of me so why the hell wont he just let me go.\n\nTDLR: tried to break up with my boyfriend but he turned nasty",

      "body": "I'm an idiot. I'll try to keep this short. Also, I was a bit drunk when this happened.\n\nNoah and I have been best friends since 2nd grade. We live together with one other friend near the college we go to together. He came out to me when we were in high school. It didn't change anything. When we got to college, I came out as bisexual.\n\nLast night we were hanging out with some friends and I had a bit to drink. When we were walking home I could tell he was nervous so I asked what was up. He asked if I wanted to go out with him. He literally said \"do you want to go out with me\". I don't know why, but I thought he meant as friends. Thinking back he made it really obvious it was a date, but I'm an idiot and I was still a bit drunk. I said yes. He suggested Saturday night. I said yes.\n\nI left to go to the gym before he got up so I didn't see him. While I was at the gym, the friend we live with texted me that Noah was really happy this morning and she didn't know we were going to go on a date. She congratulated me and said we make a cute couple. This happened literally six minutes ago. I'm panicking right now. I don't know what to do. I love him but he's like my brother. I can't go out with him. How can I tell him I'm not interested without embarrassing him more than I have to? I don't want to mess up our relationship. We're supposed to have lunch together in a few hours. What do I do?\n\ntldr: I'm an idiot. My best friend asked me out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date. How do I fix this as easily as possible for him?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you guys so much for the advice. I only saw the first 30 something comments until just now, and I'm blown away by how many people have commented to give me advice. I tried to take a lot of the advice I got, but some of it was contradictory so I couldn't do all of it. Thanks again to everyone who gave advice, even if I didn't see it until after we talked.\n\nI texted Noah and asked if we could skip lunch and go home instead so we could talk. I tried not to make the conversation dramatic. I apologized to him for misunderstanding him, and told him I knew it must have taken a lot of courage for him to ask me out. I told him that he was my best friend, I loved him, and that would never change, but I had never thought about a romantic relationship with him. I apologized for fucking up and getting his hopes up. He asked a few questions, like did I really not know he meant it as a date. He apologized for \"fucking things up\" between us, but I told him that I wasn't uncomfortable with him feeling that way about me. I told him that I understood if he wanted space to process it, and I would give it to him if he wanted, but I also told him how important he is to me and how much I love him. He said he didn't think he wanted space. He just wanted to try to move on with the secret out.\n\nWe've always been totally open with each other (well, except for him liking me I guess) and he said he was happy he wasn't keeping his feelings a secret anymore. We had a cheesy moment where I told him he could always talk to me, about anything. It was like straight out of a romcom. We talked for a long time after that. Apparently he's had a crush on me since before he came out in high school, and after he had a few drinks last night he decided fuck it, why not try. By the time he had to leave for his class this afternoon, things felt normal. I don't feel weird knowing about his crush, and he doesn't seem to feel hurt or anything because of my fuck up. Maybe just a little sad. I'll definitely keep an eye on how we interact and how he acts for a while. A few people warned me against accidentally flirting with him, and I'll try to keep anything like that in check.\n\nI guess this is a happy ending. I know there are still things to be aware of, but right now it looks like the conversation went pretty well. Thanks everyone for commenting and supporting. It helped me not just with advice but also with calming me down when I was really panicky this morning.",

      "body": "Hi Relationships, I'll try to keep this short and blunt. Please don't judge before you've read the entire thing, I promise I'm not as awful as I sound in the title. \n\n\nI've been with Matthew for 3 years now, and we have a perfect relationship. I know everyone says that, but it really is true. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I've only met his family a few times because they live pretty far away and my boyfriend had a huge falling out with his father a couple of years ago. They've since patched things up, but it's still not the same as it was. Matthew is not particularly close to his sister because she's 12 years younger than him and he doesn't see her that often. Of course he still loves and adores her, but they're not a very close family. Jessica has cancer and as a result has lost all of her hair. Matthew was devastated, obviously, and has been going to visit her more often. I have only seen her a few times since, because of work commitments. I have been down twice alone (without Matthew) to visit her in hospital. She’s a lovely young girl and I’m devastated for her and their family.\n\n\nJessica is home at the moment and Matthew's mum called last Friday and asked if we could go over there. Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica. My job is modelling. I have very thick, natural auburn hair that reaches my waist. It's one of the reasons that I'm fairly successful. It's one of the reasons I can afford to pay the bills. I couldn’t model without my hair. So I respectfully and politely declined, telling them that it would be detrimental to my career. I don’t have two jobs, I don’t have a back-up, this is my job. It’s my money maker. If I couldn’t model, I don’t know what I would do. \n\n\nMatthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important, I cannot afford to lose my hair. I have to think logically about this otherwise I won’t have a roof over my head. Matthew’s mum was very upset, and proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn’t shave my hair because I am vain. I apologised to Jessica and explained my reasoning, and I went home. I have barely spoken to Matthew since it happened as he says he ‘needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship.’ I told him that I would do anything other than shave my head. I'll do a charity run, I'll raise tons of money, whatever I can possibly do, instead of shaving my head, but he won't listen. All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'.\n\n\nDid I do the wrong thing? \n\ntl;dr my career is modelling and part of my success is due to my hair. My boyfriends younger sister has cancer so the family shaved their heads in support of her. I declined, and now everyone hates me.\n\n\nedit: a few people have asked so I'll copy+paste this from one of my replies: Matthew told me that Jessica is very upset and has told all of their family repeatedly that she hates me for having long hair and refusing to shave it for her. She's only 13 years old though, I have a feeling that the family are perhaps poisoning her view and of course she's going to be having a difficult time as it is. I can't hold any grudges against a young girl being in such an awful situation.\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm completely overwhelmed by the support here, so thank you a lot. I have read every comment and most of them are very helpful and make me feel a lot better. I am going to give it another few days and then I am going to speak with Matthew and his mum and Jessica. I'll be sure to post an update soon. Thank you again. \n\n\n*Edit 3: gosh I hate threads with a ton of updates when there's no real update but I feel the need to defend Matthew's family a little. They're not crazy people. They've always been absolutely lovely and kind and welcoming towards me. They were a normal, happy family before this happened. Their youngest member of the family, the innocent, sweet, vulnerable girl is dying and there's nothing they can do about it other than try to make her happy. Of course their view is clouded, of course they're not being rational. Matthew's mum has quit her job to spend more time with Jessica, they've spent every penny they have on gifts for her. I don't think they're crazy or bad people. They're in a world of hell and the only thing that makes it better is putting a smile on Jessica's face and me shaving my head would have done that. If they don't come to terms with it and start thinking clearly soon, then I will agree with everyone and I will call them crazy and run for the hills, but at the moment, I'm trying to be as supportive as I can to my boyfriend and his family whose hearts are all broken. Put yourselves in their shoes.*",

      "body": "Update to my earlier posts here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fwuub/update_i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a/\n\n\nAfter going through all the comments(thanks for the advice!) I decided to send my mother an email letting her know that I will absolutely not be paying for the new place she made plans to move to, and that I will stop paying her rent all together. I told her that she clearly does not respect me or the work I put in in order for me to be in a position to give her the money that I do. I also told her that I would not be financially supporting her in any way. \n\nA few hours after I sent the email my phone starts blowing up. Calls over and over again. I still really didn't want to talk to her so I ignored them all. A little while later I get a call from my friend Dave, except when I answer the phone it's my mom. I found out later from Dave that she showed up at the bike shop he works at and made up some story about story about her locking her purse with her phone and keys in the car and needing to call me for a ride. \nShe immediately goes off on me about how ungrateful I am and that she is disgusted by the email I sent etc. She told me that it's my \"duty\" to make sure she is well cared for and comfortable, as she is the reason I'm here in the first place. The worst part was when she told me that if she knew I was going to end up this way that she wouldn't have put her life on hold for the last 2 decades in order to have me, and that I cost her her job and my dad and a bunch her her life plans. I couldn't even get a word in with all her yelling. The last thing she said was something along the lines of \"you need to have a come to jesus moment and realize how much you are hurting your mother. I have already packed up most of my stuff and have spent a ton of time setting this move up. I expect the $8500 before the weekend is over in a cashiers check so let me know when you have it.\" and then she hung up. \nI don't think I have even been so mad in my entire life. She pretty much just told me that I need to make up for everything she missed out on in order to have me by giving her money and making sure she's taken care of. \nI called her back and she tried to start talking and I don't remember exactly what I said because I was so angry but I basically told her to shut the fuck up and let me talk(but with more swearing and yelling) I'm usually pretty calm and would never swear at my mom(I would never even swear near her) and I know I shouldn't have said that but I wasn't thinking straight. I told her she better find another place to live or pay her rent herself because she wasn't getting another dime from me.\nI turned my phone off after that because I didn't want to deal with anymore calls or texts. I eventually needed to use my phone so I turned it back on and just blocked her number. I saw that I had some calls/messages from her but I didn't want to look at them.\n\nThis morning I got a call from the front desk at my building telling me that my mom had tried get up to my room, but I had already told the elevator staff/security to take her off my guest list. Apparently she caused quite the fuss when they wouldn't let her up. \nShe is blocked on my phone now so I haven't heard from her today yet, but I expect her to blow up on me again for what happened this morning. \n\nI think she's probably in denial and thinks that I will cave and pay for her new place. I'm worried about what she's going to do when the deadline for her to pay for her new place comes up and I refuse to give her any money. The move in date is pretty soon and I'm sure she has to pay it pretty soon, I'm actually surprised she hasn't had to pay already. So that's going to cause a massive shitstorm. I'm really really worried about what she's going to do.\n\nThanks again for all the advice! \n\n\nTLDR: \nMom showed up at friends work and used his phone to call me because I wasn't answering her.\nYells at me about not doing my duty and how I owe it her to take care of her because I basically ruined her life. \nSays I have to give her rent check by the end of the weekend.\nTell her she isn't getting a dime from me and hang up\nShe tries to get in my building but isn't allowed.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!",

However, everything kind of came to a head last week when Gavin started telling other people on the team that a few of us, including me, were making his wife feel awkward. I think some of the original commenters predicted this would happen, albeit in a slightly different way. He didn't tell me directly and I found out from the other people who had been accused.\n\nI then decided to talk to the CEO about Gavin. \\*I didn't mention Donna or her work quality\\* but I wanted his advice and input on whether I was making anyone uncomfortable. I also gave my side of the story, focusing on how the accusation dampened my morale and pointing out that I feel like outsider sometimes since most people in the company are old friends. Fortunately for me, he didn't see things the same way Gavin did and said he would speak to him.\n\nAfter the meeting, the CEO quietly took Donna off my projects and reassigned her something small and not really connected to the core business objectives to work on. He's also now interviewing someone from outside the friends and family circle to take on the lion's share of what Donna was originally assigned to do. Gavin has been told to provide more direct support for Donna, which he seems annoyed about but obviously isn't going to fight.\n\nTL;DR: I'm lucky my CEO is a wise dude. All in all I think this is a good and fair outcome for everyone, though things with Gavin and I will almost certainly get worse.\n\nThanks for all the advice in the original post.\n\nOMG thanks for the gold kind stranger!",

      "body": "Original post: [https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f\\_acts\\_like\\_im19f\\_the\\_other\\_woman/](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f_acts_like_im19f_the_other_woman/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo years after posting this, I can safely say that my family is irreparably fractured. My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why \"she is like this\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. \"Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?\" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see \"both sides\" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: stepmom has ruined my family and I don't think it is fixable.",

He still eats mostly meat, but has moved on to things like bacon-wrapped meatballs and burgers. The fried chicken was more occasional, and he improved his cooking style over the year.\n\nShortly after I made the original post, we talked to Louis about the jokes he'd been making concerning the incident. He genuinely didn't know he had offended people and apologized to everyone he thought necessary. Things were mended on that front pretty quickly.\n\nWe have since left that job and that housing, and so has he. But Louis proved to be one of the best roommates we ever had. He was reliable, fun to be around, and hard working. We consider him one of our close friends now, and are very grateful to have had the experience of living together. Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post, your advice was sound and you all helped me feel much better about the situation, which ended up turning out great.\n\nTL;DR: Fried chicken-obsessed roommate expanded his palate.

      "body": "[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/)\n\nMy original post blew up in a way I totally wasn’t expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it’s been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn’t able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could.\n\nThere are a few things I’d like to clear up since they kept coming up:\n\nShe is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don’t see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that’s been bugging me about this that I hadn’t even realized.\n\nIt is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue.\n\nHer motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn’t overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It’s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don’t want kids. So money is not an issue.\n\nSo I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn’t want to talk about it. \n\nI told her that I’m invested in solving this problem and that if we’re unable to do so we can bring it up during couples’ counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so.\n\nThis seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she’s overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit.\n\nWhen she’d gotten past that I didn’t want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things:\n\n* I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she’s making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy. \n* These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:\n    * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.\n    * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she’s cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen. \n    * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology.\n\nShe said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples’ activity. \n\nI asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up—about how I was behaving or how she feels—and she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later.\n\nThat was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room. \n\nI felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me.\n\nUltimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night. \n\nI have started looking to get a couples’ counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: We're going to couples' counseling and have implemented a new meal schedule.",

      "title": "I asked my bf for alone time and he told me to pack my stuff and leave for good.",
      "body": "Okay, the title does seem a little one sided. \n\nContext: My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been dating since last summer. I live alone in an apartment in downtown DC and he lives alone in a house in Annapolis about 40 mins away. Pre-quarantine, we did well will splitting weekends between the two places. Once states closed for COVID, we decided it made most sense for me to temporarily move in/stay with him in the bigger space with a yard for the dogs. \n\nAs you might imagine, it’s had its ups and downs. We were getting a crash course in living together in a space that wasn’t really mine at all, having lots of important conversations, enjoying evenings cooking together and having wine while watching shows together. \n\nWe’ve also been irritable due to drastic changes in our daily routines. I have continued to work full time from home (+ overtime due to an even busier schedule) while he is only working a half day once a week. He is bored. I am stressed with work and finding it difficult to decompress. I am used to/need quiet time to myself to recharge and he likes a noisy household (TVs always on, music on top of that, chattering constantly about sports or draft statistics or things only of interest to him). I’ve tried saying “I’m going upstairs to read” or “I’d just like some quiet time to myself” and it bugs him that I don’t want to do things that he wants. I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn’t fair to him. \n\nLast night he wanted to watch the NFL draft so I made plans to FaceTime my girlfriends upstairs while he did that. I am used to weekly girls nights and miss them as they’re also my primary support network. I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. After FaceTiming I went down and sat on the sofa with him and said “hey I heard you talking to the dog, I came to hang out, how are *your team’s* picks doing?”. He was irritable and replied “ugh it was quiet until you came down”. I’m feeling like I can’t win. \n\nAlright; getting to the point now. I hadn’t been to my apartment in over 3 weeks and needed to go check on it (it’s not in a building, it’s in a row house) and pick up prescriptions I couldn’t have transferred. We were originally going to go together but seeing this irritation with each other I suggested I’d just go alone and take a night or so to myself to recharge and come back. \n\nCOVID NOTE: I do not have to interact with anyone to access my apartment. My car already had ample gas. I literally drive from his house to my street, am alone in my apartment. Any exposure to no-contact takeout I would have gotten is the same as if I were there with him. \n\nThis morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn’t want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me. \n\nReddit, I just wanted to read in silence, get my medications (anxiety pills), water my plants, sleep in my own bed alone for a night, watch my own trashy TV shows without interruption. And now I think my relationship is over? I’m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up. \n\nTLDR; boyfriend said if I wanted a night alone I should just take all my stuff from his house and continue to stay alone through the rest of quarantine (no added exposure risk). I’m confused with his all-or-nothing approach. \n\nSo, what do I do from here?\n\nEDIT: wow, this post blew up. THANK YOU for such thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary. I’ve felt really supported and “seen” by a lot of these replies. \nI’m still reading through and responding to comments but wanted to provide a quick update re: some things I keep seeing pop up. \n\nI am home in my own apartment, alone. He has not contacted me. I spent yesterday drinking wine, cooking, listening to music softly, FaceTiming girlfriends, caring for my plants, and reading a good book. (And checking reddit of course). I am not crying or sad. I feel comfortable and at ease in my space again. \n\nWhile bf is not working, he is still being paid his full salary. \n\nWhile I am currently working a lot, I normally have a much healthier work-life balance. Some big deadlines happened to coincide with and be exacerbated by the pandemic. it’s only temporary (a few weeks of hellish hustle). I was very clear with my boyfriend before this upswing started, and let him know I was going to be a lot busier and would appreciate his support extra for a couple of weeks until things settled down again. \n\nMany of you have brought up quality time. I have attempted to express my desire for quality time to him. Things as blunt as “let’s hang out together tonight, what should we do?” Or “We’ve been sort of coexisting, let’s plan to do something together more like quality time.” Perhaps I wasn’t resonating with his communication style. Sometimes it would work and we’d have a nice dinner and watch a show together etc. and other times it would end in frustration and not go anywhere. \n\nIn regards to the mattress thing, I am hearing all your replies about how it just wasn’t important to him so he didn’t want to compromise. It took my having a very dramatic hysterical emotional breakdown after nights of no sleep for him to realize how important it was we find a solution. That breakdown was loud and ugly on my part and not a moment I am proud of. It came after numerous “I’m really not sleeping well, I need more sleep than you do, can we work something out so I’m more comfortable” conversations. \n\nI am in therapy and understand I am a highly flawed human with dramatic emotional tendencies as well. I do not always communicate well. I consider myself very self-aware and make concerted efforts to require my default actions to create a better life for myself and my loved ones. \n\nAnd, finally, you are all not wrong that I have a low bar for thoughtfulness. It’s not really something I’ve ever experienced in a relationship.",

      "body": "Original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vjpo1/my_56_m_daughter_18_f_has_a_new_29_year_old/?utm_source=mweb_redirect&compact=true\n\nThis is an update post! Hello everyone! I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice.\n\nAnyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier.\nI told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the \"he has work\" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad.\n\nSo anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said \"Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad\". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it & that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do.\n\nA few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if \"things got bad\". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her \"you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!\" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said \"if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!\" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said \"I have never seen you so angry!\"\n\nI never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :)\n\nTldr; they broke up!\n\nEdit: HOLY SHIT this blew up!! I'm at work so I can't read or answer much of the replies but I'll get to everyone tonight hopefully! & for all those who are wondering- yes it was pinch not punch. No typo there! Thanks everyone for the support its amazing to hear! :)",

I told my husband, shortly after I posted the story here because I was feeling very anxious and he was going to pick up on that anyway. I don't think I have to say that my husband was livid, I never saw him like that before. After a lot of talking, I ended up learning a lot about the relationship between him and BIL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo keep things short, BIL is a huge asshole who has ruined relationships for my husband in the past. The only reason he didn't ruin ours was because my husband put a lot of distance between himself and his own family. His family by the way, always chalked it all up to sibling rivalry and never did anything to help, so I don't blame him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happened after:** My husband called BIL and asked him to not contact us anymore, he only wanted him to apologize to me for dragging me into this. BIL denied his request saying it was just a joke and I should be able to take one like a grown up. He hung up on us and that was that for a few days, until we received a call from my MIL who was very angry. BIL had told her and my FIL what had happened and that he was very upset that he couldn't even make jokes without my husband making a big deal out of it. So MIL was calling to say that we and my BIL's family weren't going to be invited to family gatherings anymore until everything was solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my husband about the call and he was surprisingly calm this time around, saying that it was the usual behavior and that if I wanted to he would make an effort but he didn't care very much. At this point I was angry myself because I never saw this behavior in his family before and it was etremely frustrating. I told him not to bother and that it would be up to him to decide. We kept mostly to ourselves since and nobody reached out to us either. Until monday, when my FIL called us to say that BIL was invited to spend christmas with the family because his wife was pregnant. He only wanted to make sure that we knew this because he didn't want us showing up to \"ruin everyone's good time\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe and my husband ended up laughing about it later because it was so absurd. But I noticed that it has taken a toll on my husband's mood and I'm debating suggesting therapy for him because I feel like there's a lot he doesn't feel comfortable telling me. We're going to spend christmas with my parents and I hope my husband will be able to tune out from this entire situation and have a good time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR BIL said it was a joke but he was offended that we didn't take it as such. Shared with the family what had happened and eveyone ended up getting banned from family gatherings. Except now BIL can go home for christmas because his wife is pregnant. We cannot because we would ruin the party.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** I didn't expect this to get the attention it did. I've been reading the comments and I want to say thank you to everyone who shared resources to help us moving foward. A lot of people have  also been telling their own stories and I can't answer them all but know that I read it and your advices are being heard. This has helped me to get some perspective as I cannot share what happened with my close friends. My husband is aware of this post and he will read it in his own time, right now we will be focusing on the holidays and he would rather deal with it once the celebrations are over. Thank you once again to everyone!",

      "body": "(My first post) [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3pcfi6/want_some_advice_on_how_i_29f_can_come_clean_to/]\n\ntl;dr of first post: Want to tell my close friends of 6 months that I lost my husband, daughter and a pregnancy 3 years ago and have lied to them about it by omission since we met.\n\n\nSo I really want to first take a moment to talk about how awesome my experience in this sub has been. I knew that I wanted to tell my friends the story of my past, and I knew they would react pretty well, and I knew they'd be supportive and we'd remain close friends. I really just didn't know how to bring it up after SIX months. I don't know if I expressed it in my first post, but 6 months is kind of a long time, I feel so close to these people in so many ways, so mostly it was just weird to me to not be able to casually mention my family. I absolutely still have days where it's hard to get out of bed and I just want to be left alone to cry in the dark, but so many times I think of happy memories with my family, and adorable things Veronica did that I'm reminded of and I want to be able to pepper those into my conversations. I struggled with HOW to tell people. One on one? Big group dinner? Email? So I actually emailed them all the day after my first post here and invited them over for dinner the next night if they could make it on short notice. I said to please bring their SOs, but told Kelly I'd explain later why I think she shouldn't bring her kids this time. Honestly I was just afraid she'd get really upset and wouldn't want her kids to see her like that. She couldn't get a sitter, so her husband stayed home with the kids, but Brenda and Luke brought their SOs, and I made a huge pot of chili and some cornbread. I feel like they sensed something was up, because honestly I thought the odds of them all being able to come with one day's notice was unusual. \n\nThey showed up early evening, we sat in my living room (tight quarters!) and had some wine, and then I started. I'm an awkward person, so I basically said \"I have some big information about my past that I really want to share with you. It's not something that I share with everyone I meet and it's hard to bring up, but now so much time has gone by and I feel so close to you all, and I really want you to know this part of my life. I think it'll be emotional for you all to hear about, and I think it'll slightly change our dynamic for a while, but I'm also really excited to share this with you.\" A couple of the girls were already teary. I didn't know if they'd googled me and already knew what I was going to say, or if they could just sense the emotion in my voice. I wanted the next part to be really blunt and not beat around the bush and first set it up so they wouldn't see where I was going. I said, 3 years ago my husband, 2 year old daughter and I were in a car accident when I was 5 months pregnant. My husband and daughter were killed instantly, and I lost the son I was carrying, but was otherwise physically okay.\n\nEveryone was silently sobbing at this point, including me. I told them why I moved away, why I wanted to start fresh, and why now I needed them to know my story. Kelly got up and came over and sat on the floor by my feet and cried into my lap for a while. I stroked her hair and told her it was okay, and that her kids are the first kids I had contact with since Veronica and it genuinely gave me so much joy to be around them, and that the only thing I would change is that I'd like to share stories about our kids, talk about what Veronica liked to play with or the \"words\" she would say, diaper rash. We were all still crying, but there was a lot of smiling and joking too. I tried to break the ice a little bit with Kelly and said \"you know what this means right? I have had a baby and still look hot in a bikini!\" We giggled, she said OMG I can't believe I said that, I said I take it as a compliment and assured them all I would not hold anything against them they said previously that in the light of this new information could now be seen as offensive. \n\nIt wrapped up so neatly like a goddamn sit com! I mean, they are good people and I knew it would. With all I've been through I'm choosey about who I let into my life and I could tell they were good people who would react well, but they've also all been friends for SO long, it always kind of feels like I'm the new kid and we aren't on equal footing. I am glad I told them all together though, instead of telling them individually. I honestly don't think I could have handled that emotionally, going through it took a lot out of me. \n\nBrenda actually said that when we first met and she was looking up to see if I had Facebook, she came across a headline about my accident but didn't click on it because the headline was so horrific and she assumed it was just someone with the same name. We finally ate chili around 10:30. I do think they'll tread lightly around me for a while, but I also think this is going to bring us closer. And I don't intend to bring my family up often, but I'm glad now I can share stories about my wedding planning, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I never wanted someone that I could cry to about missing my family. Honestly....that's mine and mine alone. I still go to therapy, so I'm not keeping it inside, but it just doesn't work for me to express my grief over my loss to others. Thanks for helping me talk this out Reddit.\n\nThank you to those of you who sent me PMs sharing your own losses or just wishing me well. I could not have had this particular conversation with anyone in my real life. You were really here for me. That means a lot.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I spilled my guts to my friends and it went as well as I could imagine. I think it'll bring us much closer.",

      "body": "Really quick update to this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/elwlz8/should_my_brother_17m_and_i_17f_invite_my/)\n\nMy twin brother and I talked to my oldest brother yesterday about inviting the brother and sister over for Chinese New Year because they didn't have any family.\n\nHe just laughed at us and said yes, it was fine and said he knew exactly what we were up to with the baker/brother but in like a really smirky kind of way. \n\nI think they've already been talking or maybe even dating but he refused to say any more than that and kept telling us to get ready for school and that \"good things take time\" and acting all \"wise\" and \"older brotherly\" and just annoying. \n\nSo I told him he'd better get married by the end of the year so I could get more red pockets next Chinese New Year and he just laughed at me. \n\nWhen I went to the cafe after school today his crush told me that my brother had invited them over for Chinese New Year so I was \"oh really?\" and he kind of laughed at me too and told me I was a good sibling. \n\nSo they are clearly together or together adjacent or something. Maybe they want to announce it on Chinese New Year.\n\nBut when my brother asked me what I wanted to eat on Chinese New Year I gave him a list of wedding foods and he asked me if I was getting married. But he's just been laughing at me and my brother the whole time. \n\nSo we've just been annoying each other back and forth until he bought us ice cream to shut us up but he did give us hugs out of the blue today so I think I'll just leave it at that and they can take their own time with whatever it is they have going on.\n\nBut I do kind of want to tease him about it because I have little sister privileges and I can only abuse them for another year.  \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Update, looks like there's already something going on and they are coming for Chinese New Year but my brother is being coy.",

      "body": "Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92ssov/my\\_28f\\_friend\\_41f\\_announced\\_she\\_is\\_getting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92ssov/my_28f_friend_41f_announced_she_is_getting/)\n\nSo after reading all the responses here, I became increasingly more concerned. A background piece not included in my original post is that all the players in this scenario are connected by a recovery community. Because of this connection, I knew the \"ex\", Ashley, some years ago and we were still on one another's social media. I decided to reach out and ask about James.\n\nThat evening Ashley called me and we then conferenced in James. As it turns out, he is married to another woman and they have a child. He and Ashley never dated and aren't even really friends, they simply used to chat at a large meeting that was also attended by my friend, Wendy. They believe that she saw them speaking there and created a delusion that they had dated and Ashley was now poisoning James against Wendy, all the while he was married to another woman. \n\nOver the course of the last two years, Wendy has approached James at multiple meetings with declarations of love. He reiterated to her each time that he was married and stopped attending that meeting to avoid her. But oddly, she ended up at his meetings again and again. She approached his sponsor and friends telling them they were in love. She also approached Ashley threatening her with a restraining order because she believed Ashley was conspiring against James and her, as a couple, because they were \"together\" now. The second time she approached her, six months ago, Ashley called the police and made a report. \n\nUntil our conference call, Ashley and James didn't realize how they were connected and they didn't know the extent of the delusions. When I told them about the marriage date, they were very concerned. James called the police.\n\nI called the emergency mental health line looking for help, but their only suggestion was to call the police and ask for a welfare check on Wendy, which I did. Knowing that she has no connection to James and is living in a complete delusion made me so concerned for her. Once the wedding date came and she didn't get married, what would happen? How would she mentally process that? \n\nI was given a reference number and when I called back, was told they made contact but did not intake her since she didn't appear dangerous. Since the check, she has ignored my calls. The wedding date came and passed and I heard nothing. At this time I feel like I lost a friend, but she was already gone in these delusions and I did what I could to help. \n\nGoing forward, I hope to get updates from other people in the community that she is doing better, and hopefully abandons these delusions.\n\nTL;DR: There was no wedding or relationship, James is a real person with no connection to Wendy, she was fully delusional.",

Life took some turns! \n\nI never got around to asking him out as he went on sick leave due to stress shortly after the math exams. I didn't want to pester him when he was already going through something. I didn't, and don't, know him well enough for that to feel appropriate. Unfortunately I have no idea how he is doing now, but I hope he's okay. \n\nThe exams went terribly for me, speaking of. I did pass, but nerves got the best of me! Luckily the rest of my grades keep me at a good average.\n\nAnyway, it's not all bad. In the summer after my post - and after some horrible Tinder dates - I fell in love with one of my long term friends and fortunately he with me as well (to be fair I always thought he was beyond amazing)! \n\nSo, I'm in a great relationship now, we're moving in together and I will be a fully fledged teacher come January :)\n\nThanks for all your replies though, they were really helpful at the time!\n\nTl;dr - Didn't ask him out in the end as he went on sick leave, but life moved on and I'm in a good place, hopefully he is too.",

      "body": "In order to give some greater level warning to the community, we do want to let you all know that we have been observing that several websites, magazines, and talk shows have begun using content from the subreddit to support their work **without the permission of those cited**.  Or, in many cases, they are just outright using posts and their comments as case studies to drive their articles or discussion.  We have observed this behavior sporadically in the past, but now we are starting to see it happening with greater frequency and consistency, so we need to let you all know.\n\nTo be clear, we don't condone this kind of behavior in any way.  We are not interested in the additional traffic this behavior might bring.  We are not interested in the kind of extra guidance that users might receive from the larger audience these outlets possess.  We want to do whatever we can to make sure your decision to post *here* and not anywhere else is respected.\n\nThat's really the key here.  We get the reality.  We're taking it to the reddit admins to figure out the legal perspective because it is murky territory that isn't likely to be in our favor.  However, all the same, we moderators are still reaching out to these entities from the ethical perspective as best we can.  While our subreddit does indeed represent a public forum, you are still a relatively vulnerable individual who worked up the courage to put yourself and your situation out to this community.  Our contention and concern goes beyond a simple matter of copyright, expanding out more to the issue that someone is making spectacle and entertainment out of your very real problem.  You aren't a character in a story.  You are a real human being requesting help from other real people.  If you wanted the help of some other media outlet, you would have submitted your story to them for input.  Instead, you chose /r/relationships because in some way, you felt our community would be a decently safe and useful enough place to get help.  \n\nIf external sources continue to threaten this safety, then we risk seeing the most vulnerable and shy posters choosing to not get the guidance they are needing.\n\nWhile we understand the desire to perhaps discuss this issue in the comments, we are locking the post for now as we don't want to spur on a witch hunt against these different media sources.  The majority of them are individual writers who likely haven't considered the harm they are causing, and though we wish they were more thoughtful, directing a community of 433k members at them isn't really the solution either.  **We instead ask that you message the moderators directly with any information you have on these external sources so that we may get in touch with them and pass that information along to the admins.**",

I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out.\n\nI did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet.\n\nWe ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has \"wronged\" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to \"do right by me\" and not end things until I was ready.  \n\nIt's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.  \n\n**TL;DR: We finally broke up.**",

I tried to reply to each one and thank them, but it quickly became too hard. Thanks so much everyone. The link to my original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xnqpo/my_31m_boss_35m_just_made_me_aware_im_not_well/\n\n\n\nAnyway, to the update. I went to see my boss and another boss, one of which I wasn’t sure how she felt about me so figured it would be a good idea to ask someone I’m close to and someone I’m not to cover all the bases. It turns out it actually is just the two I’m aware of that don’t like me. However, it was also pointed out that while people do love my sense of humour, I need to be more aware around people who don’t know me because I do come across as condescending or rude.\n\n\n\nI’ve gotten lots of great tips from you all, and from my bosses as to what to work on and how to be more appropriate at work. I’m going back to therapy this week as well. It was suggested by some Redditors that I don’t seem happy and maybe that was an issue. Turns out I’m still holding a lot of pain and defensiveness from a past abusive relationship so I’m working on that too.\n\n\n\nIt’s a long road ahead but I’m going to work hard to make it to where I can let go, be happy and learn how to better understand others and be more appropriate. I really appreciate the replies from everyone, so thanks again.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - had a conversation with two of my bosses and discussed how to be more appropriate as well as figuring out how to work on the issues I have.

      "body": "Here is the original:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yn3jg/my_28m_husband_31m_of_6_years_takes_ridiculous/\n\nSo that post totally blew up. I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them. \n\nOne post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him. \n\nIt also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area \"village.\" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective. \n\nThe yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to \"call someone goddamnit.\" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because \"that's a $6500 grill on that car!\" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out. \n\nYesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a \"burden\" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson. \n\nWhile we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on \"kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to \"one upping\" and \"talking down\" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good. \n\nSo basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it. \n\nIf I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!\n\n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: follow up to my post from Monday about me being angry at my husband for taking extreme risks while doing his sports. But was probably more about me being annoyed with him not being social and me not communicating with him.",

      "body": "Original:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lgroe/my_28m_largechested_gf_of_2_years_28f_was_asked/\n\nA few things to address before I go into the actual update:\n\nI did not confront Jenna when she was going on her tirade because they were in Troy's bedroom. I have no reason to barge into someone else's bedroom to start a fight. You can stop with the pitchforks about how I was awful for not immediately wrestling Jenna to the floor in a show of manliness. Waiting for the event to pass was a much better way to handle this. \n\nHannah does not need you to tell her that she's wearing the wrong sized bra. She has been to ABraThatFits for fit checks, and she measures herself frequently and knows what works on her body. She has a wide range of sizes from when she was figuring out her fit size. If the measurements really don't make sense to you, I can't help you. All I can say is that she's a fat bottom girl.\n\nTo the actual update: \n\nI talked to Troy about Jenna's outburst. He said that he would handle it, and he was extremely apologetic and said that it would not happen again. He said he was glad Hannah didn't hear Jenna's tirade, and I agreed that it was for the best if we tried to handle this maturely. Hannah was still hurt from Jenna's comments on FB, but Troy asked Jenna to apologize, and that's what happened. We let Troy know that Jenna wouldn't be allowed over again if she continued to behave like that. He agreed and said he would be reconsidering their relationship.\n\nSome time passed, and here we are. Hannah has gone back to just being comfortable in her own home, taking her bra off when she gets home. She is respectful of Jenna and Troy's space and wears a bra if Jenna is over. But things changed the other night. \n\nHannah and I were cooking dinner when Jenna came over to wait for Troy. She hung out in the kitchen and talked to Hannah (they seemed to get along a little better at least, Hannah is very sweet and doesn't hold many grudges). I was chopping up brussels sprouts to roast while Hannah was making some herb and parm crusted chicken or something and some cucumber tomato salad that I love. She coated some huge chicken breasts that she'd pounded and that's when Jenna piped up and said something like, 'Wow, that's so much food. You're not going to eat all that, are you?' to Hannah. \n\nHannah laughed and said yeah, she was going to eat it all. It was her dinner. Jenna scoffed and made some comment like, \"That's so much food, I could NEVER eat that much. But well, look at me.\" She got up to try and get our attention and show off her figure. Hannah didn't say anything, but I could tell by the look on her face that she was starting to panic. Hannah has a long history with ED NOS and one of her only triggers is people paying attention to what she eats like that. She used to not be able to eat at restaurants because she was afraid of people judging her. \n\nJenna took it a step further and said something about how she goes to the gym every day because she loves keeping her figure and she knows Troy loves it. She pointedly asked Hannah when the last time she went to the gym was and then asked me if I thought Hannah should do some kind of Yoga or something. She made some comment about how sad it is when girls \"let themselves go\" after they get boyfriends. (For the record, Hannah didn't). I was starting to get very angry because it sounded like she was implying I do not love Hannah's figure or something. I put my hand on Hannah's shoulder and told her to go to our bedroom, I could finish up. She had the fakest smile and said goodnight to Jenna.\n\nI let Jenna have it. I dont' want to go into what I said because it was not my best moment, but I could not accept her trying to intimidate or make Hannah feel bad. I especially could not take her implying at all that I wasn't attracted to Hannah. It all felt too surreal. I've never met someone who would just say mean things about a girl who was perfectly nice to her like that. Especially not about her weight. \n\nJenna left and told me she was going to \"have a talk with Troy.\" I consoled Hannah, who said she was okay, but ended up not eating dinner. We watched some TV together and about two hours later, Troy comes in. He just stands in the doorway and looks at us and he looks right at Hannah and says \"I broke up with her. I'm so sorry. She is never coming back.\"\n\nJenna is gone and done. Troy later said that Jenna was convinced Hannah was trying to steal him and that she was just jealous of her body. It was all because of one day when Jenna came over and Hannah gushed over the dress she was wearing. Jenna thought that meant she was in love with her or something. I have no idea where this came from. \n\nIt was never about the bra I guess. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Jenna attacked Hannah after everything seemed settled. She's not coming back.",

I decided to come out to my sister in law. She took it really well and was very supportive. She suggested that she was going over that week and she reassured me that they would be mostly fine. she told me about the time when they thought she was queer and they tried to support her in their misguided but still loving way which is hilarious but also endearing. \n\nWhen she visited them she apparently laid down hints that I wanted to introduce my partner but I was scared about how they would react and that they should try to be calm. They reassured her that they would try to be cool. \n\nI visited last week. It was awkward and they were waiting for me to say something but I was feeling incredibly scared. I told them that I had a girlfriend. I was in love with her. we were about to move in together and I wanted them to meet her. They were quiet for a moment. I panicked and told them that I was attracted to men and women and that dating a woman didn't mean what I had with my husband was not real. \n\nThey told me that as long as I am happy and I was with someone nice. it didn't matter to them who I dated. They want to meet her. It feels like a huge burden has been lifted from my back. I am out to all the people that matter to me now. It is amazing. \n\nwe can only visit them next month as my girlfriend is incredibly busy with work. She is really excited to meet my family. I know they are too. I feel really lucky to have all this wonderful people in my life.\n\nTL;DR : I came out to them. They want to meet her. We are going over next month.",

He flipped. He said that I was being selfish and inconsiderate by not letting him do anal. I kept thinking of all the kind words everyone left on the original post and didn't budge. This just made him angrier. He said there are plenty of prettier, sexier, and all around better girls that would be more than willing to give him what he wants. In fact, he had plans to meet up with a girl the next day. Admittedly, that stung, but I knew I couldn't give in. The responses to the previous post really opened my eyes. \n\nSo he stormed out in a fit of rage after I didn't give him what he wanted and I started gathering all his shit and putting it into garbage bags. I was running purely on fury at that point. I left his shit outside the door and locked it. I then sent him a text that only read \"In case there was any question, we're done.\"\n\nI don't think I've ever been that pissed in my life. I can't thank everyone enough for helping me see how much of a harmful prick that guy was. You all saved me from enduring any more time of guilt and anxiety because of him. Lots of love to all of you. <3\n\ntl;dr: broke up with my shitty manipulative boyfriend. I bought some cute lingerie for myself and have never felt so free.",

      "body": "My GF and I have been together for about a year. Most everything is great except one thing: If I tell her I'm sick/not feeling well/hurt she refuses to believe me. If I have a cold, she tells me I'm faking it until it goes away and then says \"see, you are fine!\" I'm rarely sick, so it's never been a major issue. But, she has zero sympathy when I'm sick. \n\nShe grew up with hypochondriac parents who were always \"sick\" with something, often self-diagnosing themselves with fatal maladies. She has limited contact with them and the time I met them, I was told (by them) that \"they didn't have long left to live.\" I get it, growing up in that household must have been awful. But, what happened on Sunday just sent me over the edge. \n\nGF and my sister [29/F] wanted to check-out this event and we were all supposed to go. I woke up with excruciating back pain and could barely breathe. GF got so mad at me for \"ruining this\" that she wouldn't speak to me. As she was about to leave I asked her not to leave because I thought something was wrong. She said no and left. I threw up in my bed and eventually called my parents (I was too embarrassed to call 9-1-1) and my mother and brother hauled me to the hospital. \n\nI was whisked back and after ~20 minutes I was diagnosed with kidney stones. Fentanyl and gravol and I had a CT scan and then went for a procedure to bust the kidney stones. (Anyone questioning whether or not to have the procedure: DO IT. The side effects are nothing). \n\n5 hours later and I was laying on my parent's sofa in a haze. I have never, and hope to never, feel pain like that again in my life. I was sure I was going to die. The attending in the ER told me it's worse than child birth and that they've had it before, too. \n\nI didn't text my GF throughout because I really didn't have the strength or foresight. I was drugged up and uncomfortable. My sister found out that I had been in the emergency room and soon after my GF called me. She was pissed off I didn't call her. Then I reminded her that I begged her not to leave as I thought something was wrong. She got quiet and eked out an apology. I got furious and said something rather nasty things.. among them \"f-off\" and some other unsavory things. \n\nIn fairness, I was on dope, still sore, peeing blood and felt like someone had punched me in the gut. Standing was incredibly painful. I needed to take two days off of work & school, I rested in bed and the only thing you can think is \"the person who should have been there didn't even believe me.\" \n\nShe's texted me this week a formal apology and wants one in return for saying nasty things to her. I've been avoiding her texts/calls. I've felt like shit this week and picked something up in the ER so I laid low, took a few days off work and relaxed. She wants to meet tonight and talk about everything, but I'm still so mad I don't know if I should hold off seeing her. \n\nIs this as big a transgression as I feel like it is? Am I blowing this out of proportion because I felt so shitty? \n\nI just am so annoyed and angry. \n\ntl;dr GF didn't believe me something was wrong and I wound up in the ER with kidney stones and needed a procedure. She was mad that I didn't call her (I was too doped up) and then when I blew up at her she felt bad. I'm still mad at her. Am I blowing this out of proportion?",

On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her.\n\nSoon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy.\n\nWe made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography.\n\nThen came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film.\n\nWe were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it.\n\nAnyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going.\n\nYou guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies. \n\nI hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet. \n\nThanks again reddit.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Mia has friends now!",

Despite a brief period of \"improvement\" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies.\n\nI joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic.\n\nIn the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said \"fine\". So we're done. I moved into the guest room\n\nA few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\\*\\*t isn't my problem anymore.\n\nI'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore.\n\nTL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said \"fine\". We're over, and I just feel relieved.\n\nPS: Bought a lock for my bedroom door as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall edit: I realized that I failed to mention a few things on why I'm staying in the house: We do have a daughter (9), and kids make things a little trickier. I am in an intense nursing program and only work (very) part time as a tutor. He works nights so our interactions are limited to the two days he has off. I leave before he gets home and when I'm getting home from school, he's out the door. I know it would be best to find a place to stay but the resources in this area are extremely limited. My college is literally in a cornfield.\n\nI also want to thank you all for the support, I have felt so lonely for months and to have strangers be so kind means a lot to me. I'm definitely going to download  that book, \" Why Does He Do That?\", and make the time to read it. \n\nWe were married for 10 years and one commenter did the easy math....Yeah I was 18 when we married, 17 when we met. I was fresh out of a physically abusive relationship, and he was so nice to me.  Again, the kindness and support means more to me than I can express, I'm determined to be a stronger person and trust myself again.",

      "body": "My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we’ve never had a lack of affection, but that she’s unhappy and she’s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left. \n\nWe’ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren’t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn’t meet somebody else. We’ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She’s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me. \n\nAll I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I’ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she’s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I’m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   \n\nShe’s not only pushing me out but she’s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I’ve been able to gather from mutual friends she’s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she’s at it because she’s micromanaging everyone. \n\nSince she left I’ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won’t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it’ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can’t convince her that there doesn’t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren’t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can’t see any of it and I’m afraid she’s completely ignoring what she’s doing by working so much she can’t think about anything else. \n\nI hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife’s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she’s not acting like herself but they can’t say anything to her or she’ll push them out too. It’s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.\n\nI keep telling myself it’s going to be ok, she’s going to realize she doesn’t have to do this, but it’s been 20 days and I’m starting to lose hope. I don’t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can’t do on my own, but I can’t leave because I’m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of “us” and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. \n\nTl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me.\n\nEdit -\nI think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.\n\nI've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this.\n\nThe problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too.\n\nI also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them.\n\nAlso -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard. I thought we were good at communicating to one another but apparently I thought wrong or something changed and took that communication with it and I didn't see it.",

It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn’t meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us. \n\nUltimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle.\n\nWe aren't in contact this time.

I had a lot to think about and consider.\n\nTwo days before Thanksgiving I decided to ask my mom if she knew what was going on with my sister. She told me that she just found out from the kids that my sister and her husband took off to another state for a last-minute vacation, without the kids. She didn’t tell anyone and left her kids pretty much alone. My parents live nearby and would have been happy to have them over. Apparently, my sister’s mother in law lives on the property in an RV with no electricity. Mother in law has schizophrenia and does not take her meds. I didn’t mention in my original post, but the kids are 16M and 15F, the older kid does not have a driver’s license. They also live out in the woods, a good distance from the closest town. At this point, I had decided not to invite her over. \n\nThe day before Thanksgiving, my dad called and told me that he believed my sister was under the impression that she was coming to my house with her family, even though I haven’t spoken to her. I told him that her husband was not welcome, and he said I needed to tell her because he didn’t want to stir up trouble. I didn’t want to call her because she was alone in another state with her husband and I didn’t want that to start a fight. My dad took it upon himself to call her and ask her directly what her plans were for Thanksgiving. She said she was coming to my house and he told her to call me first because there are issues. She never called me and told my mom later that night that she wasn’t coming home until after Thanksgiving. My mom invited both kids to my house for Thanksgiving.\n\nMy nephew decided to go to his cousins (on his dad’s side), where there is absolutely no supervision. My sister and husband are apparently okay with this. Thankfully, my mom was able to get my niece to come with them to my house. I took the opportunity to spend some time alone with her. She opened up about her problems at home and asked for a lot of advice about college, jobs, etc. I told her she is always welcome in my home and invited her to spend some time with us on her Christmas break. I gave her my number and told her to text me anytime, especially if she needs a break from her home. I don’t know if she will take me up on my offer, but it’s there. \n\nI’m pretty disappointed that my sister would leave her kids on Thanksgiving. Her daughter was hurt by this, but now she knows there is someone that will support her and be there if she needs it. All in all, we had an awesome, drama free Thanksgiving.  \n\nTL;DR: Did not invite my sister to Thanksgiving because of her abusive husband, but was able to give my niece a lifeline which might make all the difference.",

You gave me a lot to think about so when it came time to talk to Cindy, I wouldn't trip over my words or anything.\n\nI took her out to lunch yesterday (Sunday), and just very matter-of-factly told her how I was tired of her disparaging my bf, how I was tired of her putting down nursing as a profession and dismissing it just as \"women's work\", and finally told her that despite her insistence that she was just joking, I found her \"jokes\" offensive and was done with hearing them. I made it very clear that my boyfriend hadn't sent me to defend him but that I was the one who was offended and tired of it.\n\nShe started to cry a little (which was alarming) and broke down and told me why she was doing what she was doing. Apparently, long story short, in her first marriage, Cindy's income was more than double of that of her husband. After a year or so of marriage, he quit his job and ended up just mooching off of her. He became incredibly emotionally abusive and ruined her financially until she was able to get out and leave him. Basically--she was nervous that the same would happen to me, and she hoped that her \"jokes\" would sway my opinion enough to leave my bf. \n\nI was kind of ??????? about her explanation, but she told me that she knew the jokes were childish and offensive, but she didn't know how else to go about it. She said that I was the closest thing to a daughter she had, and that she loves me very much and that she felt awful about everything.\n\nI started getting teary at this, and I told her that the jokes especially hurt from her because she's someone I care deeply for, and she apologized profusely for having offended/hurting me. She said she really thought my boyfriend was a nice guy and that she wanted to get to know him better, which thrilled me. \n\nI went home, told my boyfriend (who didn't know why I was gone, I wanted to be covert about it), and he was thrilled. He told me that secretly he WAS upset about the jokes, as he knew that Cindy was someone I cared a lot for, but put on a game face because he didn't want to drive a wedge in between us. He told me he loved me, and thanked me for standing up for him, and said he's looking forward to getting to know Cindy better too! And my dad is over the moon as well :)\n\nThank you for your advice, all! <3 Communication really is key.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Cindy and I talked, she apologized, my boyfriend is happy, my dad is happy, and my family is the best :)",

After trying to talk to my friend through October and the beginning of November I finally threw in the towel when he started being a dick on the 1st anniversary of my father's death. I kicked him out of my place and have had zero contact since. While it hurt to cut off a friendship that had lasted as long as ours did ultimately I think it's for the best. It's been 26 days since my last drink and I'm feeling more confident every day. I've discovered other friends that have been quietly supporting me and realized they were better friends than my now former roommate.\n\nTl;dr: Kicked my former best friend out of my condo and out of my life. Found life to be slowly improving due to that decision",

      "body": "UPDATE: I left and I just wanted to shout it from the Mountaintops!\n\nMy first and only Reddit post  is here [I need to leave my husband](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d1licq/i_know_i_need_to_leave_my_husband_but_im_feeling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAnd I am just so thankful for the insights I gained there. There was some blunt reality but it felt loving and it’s a big part of what made me realize I was fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habits and behaviors wouldn’t negatively effect our kids.\n\nI was encouraged to start seeing a therapist which I did. The first one I tried ended up being a beautiful fit which I regard as nothing less than a miracle. She was blunt and insightful and gave me the courage I needed to face my guilts and fears and put my kids first. \n\nHe’s an addict. That is a lifelong battle. And because of everything else he has put me through and let me do alone, I just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever. \n\nIt took me just under 3 months from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubts, making a plan, and getting the hell out. Making that plan was seriously my biggest obstacle. And I let it be, I think I used it as a crutch. Finally, I sat there for 2 hours and went through every possibility till it just clicked and I went “duh! That can totally work!” 5 days later I took all my stuff and the kids while he was at work. \n\nHere is what I want to share with those who face similar situations: my therapist let me know as kindly as she could that although I did a great job of protecting my kids, there was no way I could guarantee 100% that they would always be safe there. And if they ever got into any of those drugs or were harmed because of them, my kids would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where I knew those dangers were present, for subjecting them to it. \n\nThat shattered my perception of control real fast. Because its true. We cannot watch every movement every minute. \n\nI just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 years of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness, equality, and a partnership, I was finally able to leave the man I have been in love with for 16 years. I truly believed with every fiber of my soul he was my one true love. \n\nAnd I almost didn’t make it through the first week away...it was much more difficult than I expected having grown to hate him so much...it still hurt...but I did make it through and already I am so much happier, so much freer, my kids are more loved (he is finally giving them attention), and I can see hope for us all. \n\nI made excuses for his behavior because I felt I could see the nuance of it all...But what others helped me realize is that some behavior needs no nuance to it. Some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it.\n\nSo I just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation, you might need to start talking more about your problems so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is. Then put yourself first, don’t let them manipulate you back in, and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should.\n\nTL;DR my husband is a lazy, selfish drug addict who I could just never quite convince myself to leave. But I finally shared my struggles with others who helped me see the real problems and accept the solution: taking the kids and GTFO. Already we are so much better off ☺️",

      "title": "UPDATE: My(25) BF(28) won't ask for my hand in marriage so my Dad(51) is staging a family boycott of my wedding. Is my BF being disconsiderate?",
      "body": "original post is here,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/\n\nThe wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.\n\nThe wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.\n\nThe reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no.\n\nHe also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.\n\nHe called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous.\n\nCoincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.\n\nMy husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters.  Everyone is banned from our lives.",

      "body": "I got kicked out by my parents a few years ago because of my choice of career. I'm a cinematographer. When I tell people that I got kicked out because of my occupation, they always think I went into something drastic like porn or something. But nope. I'm a filmmaker.\n\nSome context - my parents are African immigrants (Nigerian dad, Kenyan mom). I have three older siblings. The oldest is a doctor, second oldest a lawyer and third oldest an engineer. I was supposed also to into engineering (structural). I studied it in college. My parents were dead set on me becoming an engineer like my sister.\n\nA lot of African immigrants who come to the West want their kids to have jobs like those my older siblings have. When I graduated, I told them I was going to try my hand at filmmaking. When I was in college, I dated a chick who was going to film school. She was an editor and she introduced me to filmmaking. I fell in love with it and began learning as much about it as I could. That summer I worked my ass off and bought myself some equipment and just started shooting. Everything and anything. It's amazing how much you can improve at something when you do it over and over again. Even shooting things as mundane as flowers made me a better cinematographer.\n\nI began gaining ability with the camera and during college in my free time, I started shooting stuff like music vids for local artists, corporate videos, short documentaries. By the time I graduated I felt confident I could make a living in this trade. \n\nI was so scared to tell my parents of my decision. My dad had been talking to his friend (also an engineer) and they got me an internship at his firm. Around the same time I was offered to shoot a feature length documentary in a few countries in South Asia for six months. I chose the latter.\n\nIt didn't go down well with the rents. We had a big argument and they kicked me out. They told me I was wasting my time with filmmaking and that it would leave me penniless and on the streets. At my sister's wedding (a year later) they refused to talk to me. Acted like I didn't exist. That was the last time I saw them.\n\nWhen I got kicked out I had just graduated from school. I didn't have much. My brother (the lawyer) took me in and I stayed with him for 16 months while I worked in order for me to get my own place. I'll never forget what he did for me. My other two siblings also thought I was wasting my time with filmmaking and but he was the only one who was so supportive and had my back throughout everything.\n\nThings are good now. I'm financially independent. My career is in a good place. Getting a steady flow of jobs. I'm also engaged and get married next year. \n\nThe other day I got a message from my mom, asking how I was. She also apologized for everything that went down. She wants us to meet next weekend. She said my dad is too proud of a man to say that he wants me back in his life, but that is certainly the case.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI haven't decided on the course of action I'm going to take. I'm inclined towards meeting her. I do miss my parents. Even though I am still hurt and angry towards what happened. And smug too, I'll admit. They thought I would fail. Almost prayed for it to happen. It didn't. How do you guys think I should approach this thing? How do I approach the meeting with my mom? I've been thinking about it over and over again. I'm nervous.\n---\n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question",

I got to the grave site before the funeral procession so that I could go over the event proceedings with the conducting officials. They were very nice and understanding of me wanting to play. They told me what my cue would be to begin playing, I took my place about 10 feet behind the grave (everyone would be gathered in front of the grave), and waited for the procession to arrive.\n\nI was very nervous, but I knew that I wanted to follow through with this no matter how it went. Once everyone was there and the casket was set in place, a pastor stood before the crowd and offered some final words while the two air force representatives stood on either side of the casket. After the pastor was done speaking, the representatives saluted and I knew it was time to begin.\n\nI took a deep breath, brought my horn up to my lips, closed my eyes and began to play, starting on a D, as some people suggested (it is a lower note, and is easier to play, and no one knows the difference).\n\nWell reddit, it was perfect. I couldn't be more happy that I was able to honor my grandfather as he asked me to before his passing.\n\nI just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words and suggestions.

      "body": "[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rs0rh/me_intern_21_m_with_my_boss_41_m_i_forgot_to/)\n\nSo pretty much all of the advice in the original thread was useful, but some of the best advice came from users like /u/frehsprints (who pointed out that I was probably misunderstanding what my boss meant by \"reimbursement\") and /u/mawkish, who stressed going through every available channel with the software company to get a refund and making my boss explicitly request money.\n\n\nAnyways, on to the actual update. After I emailed the software company and they refused to refund it, I emailed my boss letting him know that, and that's when he dropped the reimbursement line. I still don't know exactly what type of reimbursement he was looking for, but I'm fairly certain now that what he meant was that he'd have to get it from the budget of the small team I work in and he runs, which would be a waste of money. He also CC'd our office assistant and told her to help me figure this out.\n\n\nA few hours later, she emailed back saying she'd talked to the software company on the phone and they stuck to their guns and offered a credit, and that was the best/only option. After seeing all the comments in the original thread, I gave it another shot and called the company. I basically reiterated that we've been loyal customers and would like to continue, but that wouldn't be possible if we weren't refunded. I escalated to a manager, who was more than understanding and got the refund processed!\n\n\nI then emailed only my boss (didn't wanna make the assistant feel like I did something she couldn't) saying the refund was being processed and sent him a receipt. His exact response was \"Good job /u/saltymuffaca. Stuff happens, the key is that you were adamant about it and got it fixed.\" Luckily, my boss thinks I handled the situation well, and all is well!\n\n\ntl;dr - happy update, I escalated the situation, got the refund when others couldn't, and my boss thinks I handled everything well",

I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was \"sorry\" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a \"sorry you feel that way.\"\n\nSo I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place. \n\nAgain, I really appreciate everyone's advice.

I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad.\n\nI'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.\n\nHis suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \\~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.\n\nNonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.\n\nI'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, \"you're so good to me.\" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.\n\nOn social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion. \n\nI don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.\n\nTL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it. \n\nPeople are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, \"Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside.\" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic. \n\nMy friend showed me another side to myself, a bright mirror. He changed my life. Losing him is heartbreaking.",

      "body": "Wendy and I have been friends for several years. We used to live in the same city and see one another often. I knew she had a history of traumatic relationships and had hence decided not to date, but I also knew she had a pretty intense crush on a friend of a friend I had never met, James.\n\nWhen I moved to another state, we stayed in touch via phone calls. She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together. Because these conversations became so odd, I stopped the calls and stepped away from the friendship. \n\nThis week, I visited my former city on an impromptu trip and met up with Wendy. She told me the exciting news that her and James were finally getting married after this ex had kept them apart so long. She showed me photos of a home he bought her, of horses he bought her, and of her in a wedding dress. She told me the name of the venue and invited me. Then she dropped the bombshell that James is apparently a millionaire. \n\nAll of this seemed off to me and when I got home, my concerns mounted. Her house was not packed despite the fact she is supposedly moving imminently. Money seems tight for her, she is living in relative squalor, if she has a millionaire fiance, why isn't he helping her? \n\nI did some digging. I found the house she showed me on Zillow, still for sale. I found the horses on a website for a local ranch that does tours. I called the venue and they told me they are unbooked on the supposed wedding date. All the available evidence tells me that she is not getting married. My gut tells me that her and James are not even in a relationship or have any contact. \n\nI don't know what to do next. Do I confront her? Do I warn James? Are these simply lies or are they delusions and the symptom of a serious mental illness? How do I help her?\n\nTLl;DR: My friend claims to be getting married, all evidence points to that being a lie or delusion.",

      "title": "UPDATE: When I 34f told boyfriend 36m I frequently feel judged/scrutinized by him he told me there are “millions of things” he doesn’t say. Do I need to change my perspective or are we incompatible?",
      "body": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/go2t88/when_i_34f_told_boyfriend_36m_i_frequently_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nFirst, thank you to everyone who responded to my original post. I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn’t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.\n\nI told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn’t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way. \n\nThose first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn’t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.\n\nOur relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the “innocent” insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.\n\nIn the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible. \n\nI’m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn’t talk to him like a normal person .\n\nI can’t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.\n\nThis comment from my original post rings true:\n\n“It seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.\n\nThose people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.”\n\nThe BS certainly didn’t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.\n\nI still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn’t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.\n\nIt was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It’s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies. \n\nThere is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing. \n\nWhy have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I’ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn’t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I’m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I’m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.\n\nWe have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up. \n\nAfter a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I’m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I’m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I’m making the right decision  so I know I’ll be able to handle whatever happens.\n\nAgain, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward. \n\nTL;DR I wasn’t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.\n\nOh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.",

      "body": "To see the original story, I’ve linked it\n[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dihwh9/i_24m_think_my_girlfriend_25f_is_cheating_on_me/)\n\n[MOVING UPDATE]: She left an hour ago and got all of her things. She brought her friend, who was also my friend too, and they were packing her stuff.  But also giggling like a couple of teenagers? All I did was sit and catch up on some emails from work, not paying attention to either of them. After about 3 hours, she had all of her things in boxes. She tried to take some things that were mine, and I told her calmly that she didn’t pay for it, so to please leave it with me. I contacted the nice couple we rent our house from and they were extremely supportive and are letting me change all of the locks, so my buddy and I are going to do that tonight. He is also helping me move my desk and electronics to the spare bedroom, since my ex used it as a closet and storage space. When she left, I finally saw some remorse, but I think she was just being nice to me because she was happy to be going to that guy’s house. She hugged me goodbye, and I let her because that’s my way of getting physical closure. Whenever she hugged me, she would run her fingers through my hair, and she did it for the last time today. As she left I felt sad, but I also felt optimistic because I can now live in peace without carrying that burden of wondering if she is cheating on me. From now on, my life is just me, my family and friends and of course my pets. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. If anything else happens, I’ll try to remember to update. But until then, I’ll see you all around. \n\nEdit #2: Wow thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom and support. To answer some frequently asked questions, since there’s too many responses to reply to individually I’ll post them here. \n1. After this, I don’t have any intentions to ever get back together with her. She made it known who and what she wants, so I am going to put all of my energy towards my job and family and friends. Even if she does come crawling back, I will not have her number and she will have no way to contact me.\n2. I wasn’t her first boyfriend but I was her first serious one. We got together when we were 19. I met her while I attended college and she worked at this restaurant just outside of campus. We were each other’s first couple milestones. Such as moving in together, getting animals together, giving a good part of our lives to each other.\n3. I know there is better for me out there. Thank you guys for picking me up. For now, I will only focus on furthering my career and being the man of my family since my dad passed away in July. When it’s time for me to date, I will know. In time, I will find the right one, a great one. \n4. With the suggestions of my friends and most of you, I am going to get tested Monday morning. I don’t think there was anything being passed around, but you can never be too careful. So yes, Monday morning I’m going to make sure nothing is wrong. \n\nEdit: I appreciate the advice about how NFP is not a form of contraceptive, I get that. It’s definitely not something to do if you don’t want children. However before this cheating and sneaking around began, we were headed towards marriage (me planning on proposing for our 6 year anniversary in January) and wanting to start a family right away. For us and the state of our relationship at the time, and specifically for my latex allergy, we were comfortable with doing that. We were committed to it and had no problems or scares during the 5 years we were doing it. It doesn’t work for everyone, so please be careful. Please, guys, the last thing I want is to be scolded that I shouldn’t have used that method. I’m just looking for some pick me ups and kind words. Let’s put all that other stuff aside. Thank you.\n\n\nSo update as of yesterday, I asked her how come she had grown so distant. She didn’t give me any sort of answer, so I just asked. “Is there another guy?” I got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder. She told me that I just wasn’t the one for her. She got no satisfaction from me anymore and that I was just a weight in her life that kept her down. For the record, I haven’t stopped her from pursuing her dream career, even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so. I have always been respectful of her needs and wants. I like to think I have been a decent boyfriend to her. She asked for an immediate break up, because she was gonna move some stuff into the new guys house. I told her that was fine. But she had to get her stuff out at once. I didn’t want her to come back two and three times a week to get her things. She wants nothing to do with our pets so I am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom, who could use some company since my dad passed away a few months ago. It’s really hard to see how cold she was. No tears or sense of regret. So tomorrow (Saturday) she is taking all of her stuff in her dad’s pickup truck and moving to that guy’s house. I asked her how long this had been going on, and she said 2 months. It’s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time. I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren’t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. I’m sad because this is a woman I’ve grown to love and essentially have grown with as an individual. I just can’t believe how much she’s changed over these past couple of weeks. Hopefully she finds what she truly wants and is happy.\n\nTLDR- my girlfriend I suspected of cheating on me confessed. We broke up and she is moving in with her new guy.",

But things went about as expected. She cried, I cried, she begged. It wasn't pretty. But for two weeks we've been broken up and she moved out today. The first few days were aweful. But afterwards we were able to talk to each other like normal people. And I helped her with everything I could. I let her take the room while I slept on the couch so she could have space and I tried to make myself as scarce as possible.\n\nIt's been a sad time and a sigh of relief. She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. She apologized and promised to work on herself. Which I appreciate. I told her there wasn't a chance we could get back together. We just aren't right. And she even said she is willing to try being friends after a while and I told her she is free to talk to me anytime but I won't bother her while she is getting over things.\n\nI'm going to have to work things out properly with my financial status. But this is all for the best and I'm glad It happened. I only wish I could have done it earlier.\n\nThanks again for the advice.

      "body": "I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3nv9fc/i_35_m_feel_like_i_made_a_huge_mistake_by/) a few weeks ago about the resentment I started to feel towards my wife after I had been promoted at work. I just want to say thank you all for the advice and I have a very happy update for you all.\n\nI took a week to think about the post and my own feelings. I talked it out in therapy and I came to the conclusion that I could not keep working 70 hours a week. It was destroying my relationship with my wife and son and it was also destroying my happiness. I spoke to my boss and he was very understanding and told me that there was enough in the budget to hire an assistant for me. My assistant started two weeks ago and my work load has been dramatically reduced. I have been able to work a normal 40 hour work week and I am now finally coming home before 6:00 PM each weekday!\n\nI spoke with my best friend about my wife and he knocked some sense into me. He told me how jealous he and the rest of our friends were over my wife and how lucky I was to be with a woman who is super-model attractive, yet driven and kind and compassionate like my wife. Later that night, I drank a bottle of scotch and got sloppy drunk. My wife found me puking in the bathroom and in my drunken haze I confessed to her everything I was holding back. I told her about how I felt left out because I wasn't around for our son, how I didn't feel connected to her like I wanted to be, the whole nine yards. She held me and let me cry it out and she told me that she loved me.\n\nThe wife and I are headed to couple's counseling, but we also signed up for cooking classes to build a common hobby. She says that she will stay by me as long as I stay be her, no matter what happens. I love her and she loves me and I think we are going to be okay.\n\nOne last detail that I can't think to put anywhere else: All three of us are taking a month-long vacation after Christmas in order to have family bonding time. Wife and I both agree that we need this vacation.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Pulled my head out of my ass and told my boss that I had too much work to handle. I got an assistant and relieved myself from that stress. I spoke with my best friend who knocked some sense into me about how wonderful my wife is. She and I are going to counseling and we are going to work it out.",

I took some advice I received on this post and decided we needed to take action. I couldn't stand having this guy be around anymore, receiving praise from his coworkers while none of them know what was truly happening. I talked with a few of my coworkers about it and we started looking into our options. Our company offers a hotline to report incidents just like this, completely anonymously. Finally, after a little bit of debate, one of us called the hotline and reported the incidents. We waited to see what would happen. Eventually the security team reached back out to him and asked him for more information. They said they are building a case and they need as much information as possible. After hearing this, the rest of the us decided to report our cases to further aid in the building of the case. I remember the security officer telling me that things are going to \"move quickly.\"\n\nWell I guess in a big company they don't fuck around with this. Less than a month after the initial report was filed the creepy asshole was fired. The entire department was told to meet in a meeting room real quick for some news and management laid it on us that he was gone. He was a highly respected coworker who was really good at his job. The news was met with shock, especially since some layoffs had occurred recently. I remember my heart absolutely racing when the news was being given. I couldn't believe that it was happening. I really didn't think some anonymous reports would lead to action so quickly. The creepy guy was friends with some of the women in our department, and he was texting them constantly saying that he was innocent. He quit pretty quickly once they weren't having any of what he was saying. The rumors of why he was fired spread really quickly around the office, but fizzled out faster than I was expecting. I really thought this would be going around the office for months, but after two weeks or so people stopped talking about it and things returned to normal.\n\nI really appreciate the advice on here. It was extremely helpful in my decision, and it worked out for the best.\n\nTLDR: If you want to take pictures of your coworkers in the bathroom and you like your job, then maybe reconsider. Coworker fired for this very thing after being reported.",

I don't have much confidence and this just makes me not want to leave my room ever again.\n\nAm I overreacting or am I in the right for being angry at her?\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Girlfriend told everyone I have a small dick. Now everyone's making fun of me for it and I'm really pissed off at her.\n\nedit: I think I'm going to break up with her. This was a severe betrayal of my trust and after read all of your comments, I think it's best if I break up with her.",

      "body": "Before anyone says anything, I know how stupid this sounds. But hear me out. \n\nI have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. \n\nI've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.\n\nThe worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.\n\nSo I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? \n\nI just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. \n\nAm I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room. She don't give a shit. \n\n**TL;DR: SIL always enters my bedroom unasked and this is where I hide all my messy shit when people are over. How can I ask her without sounding weird and accusatory?**",

      "body": "Thank you all. My OP from two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j12or/both_our_parents_50s_have_abandoned_my_21m_sister/\n\nSo besides reassuring her verbally continuously, making sure we do a lot of things together and being a good brother, I needed to get her into therapy and I found the right therapist for her. She's a psychologist who specializes in children's issues after divorce.\n\nThe only problem was money. I called both my parents and told them that I need to talk to them (separately) and told them that we need more money as she needs to get therapy and I want to do nice things for her and that's the least they owe us after everything. They were hesitant but eventually agreed. I'm now getting $500 more each month from my mother and $750 more from father and that is a real help. When we have extra money from what my parents give us I put it in a college fund for her and this extra money means that not only she can see a great therapist but now I can save more for her.\n\nI also talked to a lawyer as a lot of you suggested to make sure we're getting the right amount of money and it seems that we do. Of course we could go on and get them to court and make everything happen through the legal system but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her. She's much safer and better off here than in their hands. Obviously the option is on the table if they decide to stop paying or reduce the amount.\n\nAnd a couple of you suggested we do something symbolic which I liked a lot. So I bought two matching necklaces and had them engrave our names on them and told my sister that we're doing to wear these to remind ourselves that each of us will always be there for the other and we can count on each other.\n\nWe've already been to two sessions of therapy and I think things are good. The necklace has worked and she doesn't even want to take it off when she takes a shower.\n   \n**tl;dr**: I got her into therapy and got parents to pay for it. We're doing fun things together more often and we bought matching necklace with our names engraved to remind ourselves that we'll always be there for each other.",

      "title": "Update: should I move out?",
      "body": "It’s been about a week since I talked to my dad and I’ve had a couple people message about an update, so I figured I’d give one.\n\nFor those who didn’t see my original post, I (16M) had to move in with my dad (47M) and his family after my mom died and things have been extremely strained—the worst incidences being my half-brother ripping pics of my mom up and my dad’s wife leaving me locked out of the house—so I was given the offer to move out by my dad’s friend and his husband (Both 30’s M).\n\nI followed a couple peoples’ suggestion and texted my dad’s friend that I wanted to leave and they ended up suggesting we all go out to lunch. I think they could both tell how nervous I was around my dad and my dad’s friend J ended up being the one to bring up the idea of me moving out. My dad seemed completely blindsided by it and asked why I wanted to move out. J and his husband B reminded him about everything that’s been going on at home and I just kind of sat there.\n\nMy dad seemed really upset and it made me feel terrible because I already felt guilty about leaving, but then he just asked if I really wanted to go. I said yes and he just immediately agreed.\n\nIt kind of hit me that I wanted him to try and fight for me, to say sorry for everything that he’s been letting happen, and for my dad to try and keep me at home but he just let me go like it was nothing. It’s been hard after my mom died and my dad’s the only family I’ve got left, so it really didn’t make me feel any better about leaving, even though I don’t have to deal with my dad’s family anymore.\n\nB took me back to their apartment while J went with my dad to get my stuff from the house, and they had set up their extra room for me already. He apologized that they hadn’t been able to do this sooner and that they hoped I would like living with them. J came back with all of my things and they kind of gave me time to decompress. I ended up sleeping for almost sixteen hours because I was so exhausted.\n\nOver the last week, they’ve been really nice about making me feel at home and have talked to me about getting me into therapy to deal with losing my mom and everything that happened at my dad’s house. They’re also trying to figure out how to move me into a different school so I don’t have to deal with my half-sister and everyone that knew my half-brother. It’s the first time in months that I feel like I can actually breathe and I don’t feel like I’m constantly on guard. My dad hasn’t texted me much or reached out in the last week so I don’t know what’s going to happen with him but, for now, I’m safe I guess.\n\nSo that’s what’s happened so far. Thanks for everyone that gave me advice and wished me well. It’s been really hard lately and it made me feel less alone.\n\nTL;DR: I managed to get out of my toxic living situation, moved in with my dad’s best friend and his husband, and things are going okay, even if I’m still having a hard time\n\nLink to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q3xzf2/should_i_move_out_how_do_i_even_ask/\n\nEdit: Umm wow this unexpectedly blew up and I’m kind of stunned. My other posts never gained much traction so I never expected this update to get so much attention.\n\nA quick update over the last 24 hours or so. B’s sister somehow saw this and send it to him, so he and J came in and asked. They never heard about the picture incident and apologized that they hadn’t asked to get me out sooner. They had no idea how bad it was and said I can stay as long as I want or need to. I realized then that I hadn’t really said thanks to them because it’s been so crazy so I told them how much I appreciated having the place to stay. It was a really emotional moment honestly and I’m glad it happened.\n\nThey did think it was funny that they’ve been called everything from my “roommates” to my “new landlords”, so that’s helped soften the mood a little.\n\nSorry I haven’t been able to respond to many comments, this feels really overwhelming but I just wanted everyone to know that the support means a lot.

      "body": "And edit 3 (I forgot to type this as I was just going to bed): The whole reason I came here was to know how to respond to our acquaintances when they approach me about it being so great Mark came out. This is basically going to be my go to response: \"I'm happy that Mark finally had the courage to live true to himself, but divorces are always sad and unfortunately ours is no different.\" \n\nEdit 2: just realized I could edit after the lock. This is my first gold...thank you so much...this has been amazing at the all the support I've gotten. I don't even know how many private messages I've gotten since the lock and how many people have gone through this or had relatives to through this.\n\n\nThings will be static for a while but when there is news I will post an update. Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world.\n\nThank you again.\n\n\nI hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here. \n\nMark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all. \n\nMarriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count. \n\nThen about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself. \n\nHe moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this \"man\" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover. \n\nMark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further. \n\nIt happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for \"living true to himself\" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost \"shamed\" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor. \n\nIs it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our \"community\" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision. \n\nEdit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that!\n\n1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives. \n\n2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest. \n\n3. Lots of great tips and I really appreciate every comment...this was way bigger than I thought and I'm reading all of them. Thank you.",

      "body": "I live alone in a city and I've had some trouble making friends. I go to the same cafe every day and the owners have taken on almost a parental role since my family is so far away. I'm close with them and I trust them and they care about my wellbeing, so when one of the owners, Sara, gave me the number of another regular, Derek, I trusted her judgment.\n\nI know Derek a little bit from spending time in the cafe. It's a small place and we both sit at the counter so we can chat with the owners. Usually, we sit next to each other. We've chatted about movies, he once helped me with my language homework, and he's generally in the cafe hanging out most afternoons. Sometimes reading, sometimes working on his computer. He's also friends with the owners of the cafe and has always seemed like a nice person so I certainly wasn't against getting to know him better.\n\nWhen Sara gave me his number yesterday, she was selling him pretty hard. I asked her about the book she was reading and she said, \"Derek lent it to me!\" and when I asked about a card game she said, \"Derek taught it to me!\". So I said, \"okay, I get it. I'll text him.\"\n\nI texted Derek after I left the cafe and I thought it was maybe a bad idea because if things went south, it would be uncomfortable to see him in the cafe almost every day. But it seemed like Derek had already set things in motion by asking Sara to slip me his phone number in the first place.\n\nDerek told me that he could use more friends in the neighborhood and that he'd like to get to know me outside of the cafe, so we went out for a few beers. So, last night I learned that Derek is 31, unemployed, and he sees dead people. He's a full-on weirdo, which is fine. I still had fun hanging out with him and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened until I got home.\n\nIn the 10 minutes it took for me to get into my apartment and get ready for bed, Derek sent me about 20 messages about how he wanted to kiss me and asking if he could come upstairs. I told him \"no, thank you for a fun evening. good night.\" and went to bed. My phone died overnight and when I woke up and plugged it in, he had sent me more messages confronting me about blocking his number, which I didn't do. These messages were over the top and intense and honestly, they worry me a bit.\n\nIt's obvious to me that I need to back away from this person, but right now I have no idea how to do that gracefully. I wouldn't mind a friendship, but he's made it clear that he's interested in a romantic relationship. I just want to be able to get coffee and enjoy myself without any awkwardness.\n\nWhat can I do? What should I say to Derek? And should I tell Sara that this guy freaked me out?\n\nTL;DR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?\n\nUpdate: Thank you for your advice! I just went to have some coffee and talk with Sara. I didn't tell her everything but I told her I found Derek a little strange and she asked me what happened and I told her what he said about seeing ghosts.\n\nI mentioned in one of my comments that Sara shares some of Derek's interests in spirituality and mindfulness. We talked a little more about this. she's a very open-minded person. Sara knows that Derek believes he sees and hears ghosts and said she wasn't sure if it was true but she didn't believe he was deranged. I probably misunderstood some of what he was telling me about seeing dead people because we weren't speaking English.\n\nShe asked me overall how I felt the date went and I told her that he was getting pretty intense, he's too old for me, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. She told me that she thinks Derek is a good boy but agreed that he can be a little over the top and told me to let her know if he did anything else that made me uncomfortable.",

Then he asked me what the lobster thing was- he thought I'd tried to make him lobster but I explained the Friends quote and he said it was a good thing I was pretty. \n\nAnyway, I asked him if we need to make an announcement or anything but we agreed that we wouldn't say anything unless people brought it up or we need to introduce each other. Alan also said, he liked the term partner better than boyfriend and I agreed, it does sound more serious but I guess that's what this is.\n\nTLDR: Made him dinner, the actually dinner part didn't go so well but the talk did and we're \"official\". Thanks for the suggestions people, I'll be back if I need proposal ideas.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold! You guys are amazing!",

I’m excited to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I love her with all my heart and I couldn’t see myself being with a different person. I know I’m young to get married, but I’m absolutely ecstatic to start a family with my girlfriend. \n\nOur relationship is back to normal, we have sex everyday and she’s comfortable initiating with me again. She doesn’t cry in secret anymore and we’re back to our regular levels of physical intimacy. \n\nI deeply regret rejecting her proposal because in reality this is what I wanted the whole time. I just needed a few days to seriously think about it. I'm glad my girlfriend has forgiven me for this. I know both of us are equally at fault because of our lack of communication but it really did suck having to reject her. \n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** I wrote a letter to my girlfriend explaining to her when I’d like to get married and that I was open to having children with her. Her and I apologized to each other for not communicating clearly enough. We agreed on my timeline and I’m going to propose to her next year when I graduate!",

      "title": "[Update] I [30M] made a huge mistake/oversight, and really hurt my cousin [24F] right before my wedding. How do I fix this?",
      "body": "So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update.\n\nThe TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings.\n\nAnyways, on to the update.\n\nI was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship.\n\nAnyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.)\n\nMy fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said \"So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin.\"\n\nEmily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship.\n\nShe had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) \"went bridezilla\" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.)\n\nShe also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for \"her screwup.\"\n\nGuys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot.\n\nMolly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to \"quit being such a whiner\" and enjoy my wedding.\n\nSo the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation.\n\nThe wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty.\n\nThe only thing she asked was if the \"Blame Emily\" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come.\n\nShe actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the \"adults\" and \"younger kids\" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.)\n\n**TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends.\n\n**Minor Update to the update-** \n\nSo... it turns out \"Molly\" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: \"Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?\"\n\nSo going forward, please replace \"Molly\" with \"Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains.\"\n\nOh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW!\n\nShe's still coming to game night though. :)",

      "title": "I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.",
      "body": "Well, title kind of says it all. Throwaway because my husband is active on Reddit. He's probably on it now.\n\nHere goes: I've been with my husband for 5 years, married for 1.5. I've never *once* doubted his fidelity. He's great. Super smart, funny, handsome, and, I **thought**, loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt him or be suspicious.\n\nI thought it was kind of odd when he downloaded snapchat; he's not big on social media. I have one, but I'm not very active. We rarely snap each other. He said his friends were really active and he liked it better than Facebook, so. As I said, I've never had any reason not to trust him. So I thought nothing of it. \n\nThis morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said \"Mom\". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named \"Roxy\". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said \"I want your tongue inside me again\".\n\nNow. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are \"best friends\". **WTF**.\n\nI feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.\n\nHere's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.\n\nHe's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.\n\n**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. \n\n**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby & me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She \"stalked\" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting). I told him it was urgent; we are meeting tomorrow morning. I will try to update as much as I can and from the bottom of my heart, thank you all again, Internet strangers!\n\n**UPDATE:** hey everyone, so because this was a throwaway account, I never linked my email. I am unable to post an update because the link to approve it requires me to re-sign in. So, I created another throwaway account to be able to send an update. The username for my new throwaway account is thisgirlisonawire121\n\nJust so you know the update is real and not someone else.\n\n**Another Update** nevermind what I said above, my update on this account was approved.",

      "body": "What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery.\n\nI never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise.\n\nMy sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him.\n\nApparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing.\n\nMy sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said \"she's not sure\".\n\nI can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself.\n\nI don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do.\n\nPlease please help me.\n\n**tl;dr**: My sister did an abortion be able to give me part of her liver and saved my life, but it costed her marriage.",

      "body": "Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5hlsh/i\\_17m\\_cannot\\_get\\_my\\_parents\\_45m\\_44f\\_to\\_listen\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/n5hlsh/i_17m_cannot_get_my_parents_45m_44f_to_listen_to/)\n\nHi everyone! About 98% of you were super wonderful on my last post and seemed genuinely invested so I thought I'd give you all an update. \n\nIt's been just under a week now and after trying some of the different tactics and talking points you suggested, in addition to reaching out to the deaf/HOH community, my parents and I have come to a compromise, if only to shut me up. But I'm not the one that's important here, that would be Ana (6f).\n\nSo, come the new school year Ana will be going to the school my parents chose BUT we (including me!) will be keeping in close contact with her teachers, specialists, etc, her progress and talking to Ana herself about how she feels. If it seems like it isn't a great fit, we will be transferring her to the deaf school. It's a little out of the area, but I think we can make it work. \n\nI did open up to my parents a bit - as much as they could handle - and told them that I feel like I've been, not robbed but had a stunted childhood and that my academic abilities forced me to grow up quickly. That, coupled with their emotional distance and lack of physical presence with Ana, made me angry and frustrated that my opinions on her future weren't being taken into account.\n\nI wish I could say that was what did it, but honestly my points about the school not teaching Ana independence and other arguments brought up on the original post probably eased them over to my side a bit (I kept my temper even this time).\n\nI mentioned in my edit on the last post that I'd gotten in contact with a Deaf Advocacy group and they've provided some wonderful resources so hopefully sometime soon Ana will FINALLY be able to meet kids and adults like her! (She's SUPER excited by this. She's the least reserved and most outgoing sibling out of us three so I've no doubt she'll make friends quickly.)\n\nI've also made the decision to start seeing a therapist to maybe work on some of the issues that I've been reflecting on and to get some emotional support where my mom and dad drop the ball. I don't see them changing or even admitting they need to change anytime soon. But that doesn't mean I have to stay complacent. \n\nThat's...more or less the main chunk of what I wanted to say. I notice the rules say we aren't allowed to upload images so I'll just describe the drawing Ana just gave me to pin up on my office wall (she's a brilliant little artist, I'm not even biased).\n\n*An ocean surface. A large boat approaches from the left hand side, full of garbage. A great blue whale stands, mid-breech, opposing, brandishing a gun in one flipper. A speech bubble from the whale reads* ***'NO!'*** *while the ambiguously-gendered humans on the Garbage Boat scream in terror, presumably ready to flee.* \n\n(Her kindergarten assignment was to come up with a way we can protect our oceans from pollution and personally, I think she's hit the nail on the head.)\n\nThank you so much to everyone for your thoughts and feedback!\n\n**TL;DR: my parents and I came to a compromise on my deaf sister's elementary school, I am working through my issues, Ana is getting to know her community and she drew an awesome picture today.**",

      "body": "original : tl;dr:Im in love for the first time in my life with my friend, Im not sure what to do as I always thought I was asexual\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lumdd/i_26m_suffer_from_aspergers_and_thought_i_was/\n\n\n\nAfter a lot of thinking I decided I wanted to give it a shot. I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more. \n\n\n\nWe were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly. \n\nI was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the \"love you\" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings\n\n\nInstead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  \"if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out\" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face. \n\n\n\nI suck so I ended up blurting out \"I think Im in love with you\". yeah I realized I F up and said \"no I mean like, like you\" \n\n\nShe went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to \"which is it, like or love ?\". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah .... \n\n\nSo I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of. \n\n\nBut she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked. \n\n\nWe've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled. \n\n\nI told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me. \n\n\n\n So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.\n\n\n OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I ended up blurting that I love her, she said she likes me back we kissed.",

      "title": "I [23 F] caught my boyfriend [26 M; 1 year] on tinder. He swears it's not true. I'm going to lose my mind.",
      "body": "My friend came to me yesterday at lunch with screenshots of my boyfriend's tinder profile. The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like \"Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that.\" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile.\n\nSo, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, \"Look, I have nothing to hide.\" and of course the app is deleted.\n\nSo I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts.\n\nSo that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over.\n\nHe is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time.\n\nI know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.\n\nTL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do?\n\nEdit: This blew up while I was away!I'm sorry I won't be able to respond to every comment.\n\nSo I did some stuff that was kind of petty and stupid today: I made a fake tinder account, matched with my boyfriend, and he starts messaging me and immediately asks me to meet him for a drink. We agree to meet by a fountain in the center of my town and I pack up all of his stuff in a tote bag, put on a great outfit and went to the fountain.\n\nI stood kind of out of the way of the fountain in the shadows where I could watch the street that I knew he'd be arriving from. I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder.\n\nBut he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did. We didn't speak (I don't know them well), but they watched me for a while, figured out what was going on after a few more tinder messages, and left quickly.\n\nSo I wait a few minutes and I call my boyfriend and ask him where he's at. He says he's just gotten off of work and he's going to meet his roommate for a drink. I confront him with the fake tinder profile and he's dumbstruck and furious with his roommate, who he swears up and down is behind all of this.\n\nI'm at home now, just emotionally exhausted and confused. Whatever is going on with his roommates is super sketchy and creepy.\n\nadvice please?\n\nEdit part two:\n\nThank you all so much for your advice and support!\n\nA few things that I think are important\n\n* Up until this point my boyfriend and I had a great relationship. Really, no red flags anywhere. If I had already been suspicious that he was cheating this would be a much easier break for me\n* The most recent message on his tinder account when I checked it yesterday was sent to a girl he had matched with before we met. It said \"Would you want to meet up with my friend?\"\n* My boyfriend is the kind of person who's iphone passcode is 0000. I wouldn't be surprised if his roommates did know all of his passwords. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, his tinder account is still matched with my fake profile. To me, that indicates that he probably isn't the person operating the tinder profile. If it were him, wouldn't he have blocked the fake profile immediately?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people have said that he probably sent his roommates to check things out for him. I can't write that off entirely but my gut says that it isn't true. I just don't think it's very likely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to his roommates, I'm very concerned that they have been using his profile to trick women into meeting with them. The fact that his profile hasn't been deleted makes me worry that my boyfriend is in on this. So that's about where I'm at right now. I'm worried that all of them are working together to at best, scam women, at worst, assault them and my boyfriend is at least passively involved.

      "body": "[Link to original post:](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nk1p9w/i_dont_know_what_to_expect_for_my_23f_date_with/)\n\nMy head is still spinning from our date last night. I was so nervous that I felt sick and I literally almost canceled last minute, but I'm so happy that I went through with it! I told him beforehand that I had anxiety about not knowing where he was taking me and I didn't know what to wear. He still wouldn't give away the surprise but he did tell me to dress comfortably, so I just wore one of my nice casual dresses. He made us an outdoor drive-in movie theatre (don't ask me how he did it because I'm hopeless with technology) where we watched my favorite movie and he brought popcorn and my favorite chocolate! Afterwards he took me to this new bookstore cafe in our town which had just opened and I had been dying to go to. I was so happy when he finally kissed me even though I had been previously dreading that he would. We actually kissed quite a bit. I found that my heart was beating not from nerves this time, but from genuine excitement. Now I look forward to intimacy with him and I feel like it'll just make us even closer. It's still unbelievable to me that this is happening, but it doesn't scare me anymore.\n\nI never thought Connor would ever make me feel like this. In my head it just wasn't a possibility since we were such good friends. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give him a chance instead of just immediately shutting it down in fear of ruining the friendship. In reality, our friendship was never in any danger. Yes, there are real differences between dating and just being best friends but there are WAY more similarities than I was expecting. The conversation still flowed the same way it did when we were only friends and we still have plenty of fun and laughs. I'm overjoyed that our friendship dynamic hasn't changed because I was mainly worried that things would be awkward now and I wouldn't know how to behave around him. Now it feels like we're friends who just happen to be dating and IMO that's exactly how things should be. Seeing how happy he is just feels like the cherry on top.\n\nTL;DR: I was terrified to date my best friend. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and I had fun on the date. Thank you so much to everyone who calmed me down and told me to be honest with him about my anxiety beforehand because your advice really helped!",

      "body": "My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He’s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could’ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018.\n\nSince January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers “raising” his children so he doesn’t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don’t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn’t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I’m not ready for a baby right now.  I’m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he “saves lives everyday” and I don’t and ultimately most people could do my job with a “little bit of common sense” whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don’t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn’t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams. \n\nI had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I’ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn’t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn’t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn’t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you’re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or “keeping score” but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I’m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important. I may not be an MD or “saving lives” in the moment but I am making a significant difference and change in the lives of my patients and helping improve their quality of life and leading them to be healthier overall and work alongside several physicians who have recognized the positive impact I’ve had on the lives of many people yet the one who matters most to me doesn’t recognize or believe this and it hurts like hell honestly.  I’m mad and hurt right now but I know that if the resentment fully sets in it’ll be the worst case scenario. How do I stop this from happening and how do I stop feeling this way towards my husband? \n\nTl;Dr: Husband is being a jerk about my career and I feel myself starting to resent him and don’t want these feelings to get any worse towards him. How can I stop having these thoughts about him and our marriage?",

      "body": "Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2yywvd/my_28f_husband_36m_passed_away_and_now_his_best/\n\nI apologize for not updating sooner, but a lot happened the last couple of days.  Thank you to everyone who offered help and advice.  For those that offered monetary assistance, Jonah and I were in a stable position financially -- I'm going to be comfortable until I decide to go back to work.  Your willingness to help was deeply appreciated, however, and I'm truly bowled over by your kindness.\n\nI took the advice of the majority of comments, and called the chapel where Marjorie was planning her service.  I spoke with the pastor, who immediately told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me regarding the service -- apparently both Jonah and Marjorie had grown up in that church (I am not religious, and neither was Jonah as an adult).  My voicemail has been flooded, so it's definitely plausible that I overlooked his call. \n\nHe immediately expressed how sorry he was to hear of Jonah's loss, and said he had received my contact info from Jonah's great-aunt who still attends there.  He said he was surprised when Marjorie asked to have a service for Jonah, but she had claimed that Jonah and I were separated and I didn't want to be involved.  He had been trying to follow up with me, but obviously that didn't happen.\n\nHe was very apologetic, and said that we could cancel the service, or move forward in any way that felt right to me.  He said that he knew the church members would appreciate the service, since many of them remembered Jonah as a boy, but obviously Marjorie would no longer have a role.  I agreed that the service could go forward.\n\nHe called to speak with Marjorie after our conversation, and informed her that she was no longer welcome to participate in the organization of the service after her behavior.  He wouldn't tell me all that she said, but says she was distraught, and he recommended some mental health/spiritual services to her that he hopes she accepts.  She apparently apologized for lying, and asked to speak with me -- but I declined.  I feel bad if she's truly contrite, but I just have too much on my plate right now.\n\nWe had two beautiful services for my husband -- first the one at his hometown church, and then the non-religious one that I planned.  Everyone that came wanted to honor Jonah, and that's all that really matters.  I was told a dozen stories about him that I'd never heard before, and I laughed so hard I cried, then cried some more.  My cousin was on the lookout for Marjorie, and I honestly didn't think about her the whole weekend.  She turned up for the first service, and the pastor ended up speaking with her (unbeknownst to me).  My cousin says he was sympathetic but firm, and told her that her presence there would be inappropriate.  Surprisingly, she left without fuss.\n\nI'm still not sure this situation is entirely resolved, but I got to lay my husband to rest in the way he deserved, and that's the most important thing to me right now.  \n\nThanks everyone for your support.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Called the chapel, spoke with Marjorie, and had two wonderful services for my husband.\n\n[UPDATE 2]. I debated whether or not to even mention this, but this community has been so awesome I thought I might as well -- I realized this weekend that I'd missed my period, and I'm usually like clockwork.  It could just be stress, but I'm going to take a test later.  Can't decide if I'm incredibly hopeful or absolutely terrified.\n\n[UPDATE 3]. Not pregnant.  It was a long shot.  Thanks for your support.",

Plus shit hit the fan over the last few days, so buckle yourselves in.\n\nAfter we spoke about the original issue, things did get better. Then, little fragments of other controlling behaviour started to come out.\nI thought we could work through them.\n\nUntil when things came to a head. I found out he had, in fact, cheated on me.\nWhen I attempted to leave him over this, he became very, very abusive to the point where he was arrested. Three things, screamed, threatened me, trapped me in the house.\n\nI’m crushed, but relieved I found out now. Staying with friends currently. Trying to process.\n\nSo, I guess, if there’s a moral to the story - don’t ignore signs of abuse?\nBut, I can’t help the sense that the escalation came out of nowhere, and how - before - if you’d tried to tell me this would have happened I would have laughed in your face. I guess I don’t know what I could have done to prevent this. \nThe original issue seemed to be able to be worked through, but was masking... this.\n\nThank you to everyone who offered advice and support in my previous post.\nApart from that one guy who thought I’d had a Freudian slip in one of my comments and became convinced I had, actually, cheated on my partner.

      "body": "link to the original post: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y9dvs/i_caught_my_24f_boyfriend_26m_talking_to/)\n\nI wasted another year of my life by trying to help a person that never helped themselves and I'm paying for it in every way imaginable. I introduced him to the r/stopfindom subreddit, we went to therapy three times (only initiated when I caught him), I tried avoiding it, I tried confronting him. Nothing worked because he never stopped\"the cycle.\"\n\nI was going to study abroad in Asia in December and I did not need this on my mind before I went. So very impromptu on Nov. 16, I decided I could not be with him anymore.  I was sick of feeling used and lied to about something that he didn't need to lie about. I didn't have solid proof. I just had it mentally because I felt he was hiding something from me. And he wasn't trying to fix our relationship at all, even though he swears up and down he did.\n\nInstead of handling it well, he shows me an engagement ring his mom gave to him as I was breaking up with him and begged me to stay again. We didn't speak at all while I was away and I wish it stayed that way. I came back early January and our lease isn't up until February so I decided we could live together until then. And it was great until Monday, or at least I thought so anyway. We were talking openly about our feelings and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong.  He still wanted to be my friend. (Hard no.)\n\nIt wasn't until this last Monday, that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one. While he was at work his old phone kept going off so I looked at it. I fully acknowledge that since we aren't together I had no right to go through his phone but the shit I found makes me feel no guilt what so ever. If anything, I'm proud I can see him for who he actually is.\n\nI found out he went to see one of the doms he was cheating on me with in LA and never stopped talking to her, even before we broke up. And in $15K in debt from sending multiple doms money (SN: he always told me one of the traits he doesn't like about me is how badly I handle money. HAR HAR. Projecting much?)\n\nAfter I saw this I puked, packed a bag and left. I texted him that I am leaving and unless it was about the apartment, I never wanted to hear from him again.  We've been avoiding each other since. I've been slowly moving my things out and putting it in storage and I just feel emotionally defeated.\n\nI went through three months worth of messages and found a few interesting things other than the nudes, videos and pretty subpar sexting. He acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her. To which she replies, \" That's called deceit not cheating.\" He's glad that it was her. Glad that he can finally make someone happy. Glad he can please his goddess. Glad to be \"free\". Upset that I never understood him.\n\nwow. what a goof lol.\n\nHe is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely believes she cares about him and that he's in the right. He thinks she's actually his friend, while she goes out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support (something he complained about to her about me. And how he loved emotionally fucking with me.)\n\nShe is being paid thousands of dollars to stroke their ego though, so I think I would understand that you have to keep the customer happy. She got $500 off of that LA visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me.\n\nI feel like I should say that I respect sex workers and everything they do A LOT. But this specific dom is manipulative and has no boundaries. She is a half baked amateur at best who really has no clue on how to even pretend to know what she's doing. She gives actual doms a bad name.\n\nAnyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their subs well being would never do the shit that these two concocted. Like sending me a picture of her ass and saying she only did it because he asked her to. Asking him how he's going to spoil me today and him telling her that he's going to take me to get my nails done as a surprise. Him telling her how unappreciative I am of his gifts because they don't feel genuine (which they weren't lol.)\n\nI never consented to any of this and this shit has fucked me up for life. But get this, she's an advocate for mental wellness. What a joke.\n\nShe praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and was glad he could be \"free\" from all of my nagging and that I wouldn't hold this over his head anymore. (again, either she's really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person. More than likely both.) But he never told her that I was the one who actually ended the relationship.\n\nBut yeah, he never changed. He talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he's willing to risk everything for it.\n\nI should have listened to everyone's advice and left when I had the chance. I shouldn't have moved in with him. Instead, I was emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that \"he did everything he could.\" A direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six months.\n\nTo those that are questioning and still have hope for the hopeless, get out while you can. You can’t change anyone that does not want to change themselves. You can’t convince someone they’re in the wrong once they see that they’re in the right. You may think that other people may not know them as well as you do. It’s just something you tell yourself to avoid the actual truth that you’re sacrificing yourself for someone who won’t even do the same for you. Take care of yourself first because you’re only damaging yourself in the long run.\n\nSorry if this looks all over the place btw. As happy as I am that I made the decision to leave, I am super depressed and feel like I failed. I know this is all his fault, but I feel like I should have seen this coming. That besides this one thing, he was amazing. But it was a lie. Reddit really helped me the last time and that’s the only reason I’m posting here.  Because I haven’t slept in the past three days and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; I left my lying findom addicted ex and while I'm emotionally destroyed and angry, I'm glad I left. Send good vibes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** Holy Canoli! I went to sleep and came back to 1.0 k upvotes. Thank you for the Platinum and the Silver! I truly appreciate it. The comments are overwhelming and I'm trying to upvote them all but I am beyond grateful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n* For those that don't want to google, **findom is financial domination**. A more direct definition is ***financial domination*** *is also known as money slavery and is basically a fetish of people who want to be controlled by another person in exchange for money. They pay people for controlling them and the one in charge is known as a financial dominatrix. Usually, a male is the submissive who is referred to as a pay pig, a money slave, and even a human ATM because the findom can shell out as much money as they can from these subs.*\n* I don't have a problem with findom. We actually tried it together. I was uncomfortable with it mainly because I linked it with his cheating and lying. I expressed that I wanted to be monogamous and he stated that he wanted \"help\" and felt \"sick\" and wanted to change. I said that if this is what he wants to do that's fine, I'm fine with that but I don't want to be deceived and used. Just communicate with me. But as I found out from the messages, he loved emotionally manipulating me and loved to see me hurt. He got off on my pain, a direct quote. He got off on mentally abusing me, and that's not ok.\n* He also had a homewrecking fetish but I guess it loses the appeal if I consent to it I guess.\n* mini-rant: **DON'T DO THIS TO PARTNERS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR KINK OR YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY ARE OK WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMMUNICATE! GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO DECIDE ON WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE OK WITH. DON'T HURT SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY EXPRESS DISINTEREST AND GIVE YOU AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, BUT YOU ARE SO SELFISH THAT YOU RATHER LIE TO THEM AND PUT ON A FACADE OF \"WANTING HELP\".**\n* you can probably find his post on r/stopfindom. I won't link it here but if you're curious it may be still there from like a year ago.",

      "title": "My (36M) wife (34F) gave up a high paying, high stress job for a lower paying job that she enjoys. Now she feels like she doesn’t “contribute” enough in our relationship. How can I help her get past this?",
      "body": "My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been together for 5 years, married for 3, and have no children.  For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn’t like more money… hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house.\n\nOnce the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she’s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it.\n\nThe thing is, every once in a while, she’ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn’t “contribute” because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.\n\nShe recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn’t use it.  I felt terrible…\n\nI’m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I’ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I’m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She’s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job.\n\nI was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I’m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don’t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I’d love to hear how you dealt with it.\n\nThank you!\n\nTLDR: My wife’s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn’t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I’m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I’d try to explain here:\n\nWhy did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)? \n\nWhile she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn’t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time. \n\nCan she increase her hours from 15 to XX? \n\nWithout going into much detail, her job essentially gives her “tasks” each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she’s kind of maxed out where she’s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week.",

      "body": "Previous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a530uu/i\\_31f\\_wish\\_my\\_so\\_34m\\_cared\\_about\\_life\\_as\\_much\\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a530uu/i_31f_wish_my_so_34m_cared_about_life_as_much_as/) \n\nTLDR: Things are getting better, slowly but surely.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter posting here, I took some of the comments about depression and talked to my SO about how he feels and what I can do to be a better support system for him. He's still continuing therapy and his medication is slightly helping (although it'll take a few more weeks to really kick in) but he registered for his prereq classes without me saying anything or reminding him and he has been trying to help with cleaning when he can. So there has been some overall improvement.\n\nWe also talked about Pokemon Go, how he's using it as a coping mechanism and how that's okay (I cannot stress enough how I want him to still feel okay playing), but also how we can't just drop everything all the time for it. We just got back from a small holiday trip and the entire time, he kept the Pokemon Go under control and played when we wanted but not when we were doing dinner, taking parents places, and such. He showed a lot of restraint and a lot of respect for the stuff we talked about. \n\nI have also done a few raids with him and his people from discord, and I'm really glad he has this group of random Pokemon people that he knows by their Pokemon nicknames and stuff. It's actually very sweet, and not forced socialization or awkward adult-friend-making...they just go do raids, trade pokemon and know each other from these small moments. It's good for him, especially as his social circle has shrunk over the past few years. It's all so low key and low pressure that I really do think it's healthy for him to do these raids and talk to people about his hobby.\n\nI'm also trying to be receptive that his way of \"giving\" to me right now is by helping me with the game. He really likes to play PoGo with me and gets excited when I get a shiny or catch a legendary in a raid. I have to realize that while the depression stops him from acting like he cares about stuff like cleaning or eating, this is a small glimpse into what he can be like once he gets better again (and also, a glimpse of his old self). \n\nI wanted to thank everyone who shared their stories of depression and opened my eyes to the fact that there is so much more to being depressed than just being unmotivated/sad/empty. I had no idea that his motivation in the game was part of the depression and part of coping with life. Thanks for all the stories, seriously, they meant so much.",

      "body": "[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/eszfhr/my_32f_boyfriend_32m_doesnt_see_my_long_commute/)\n\nI took your advice and told him we needed to work this out now - no more kicking the can down the road with “I’ll think about it”s. I told him this on Friday and said to take the weekend and think things over and that we could talk about it when I got home - either together on Sunday (when I got back from visiting family) or in couples counseling on Monday. \n\nHe opted to talk about it on Monday in therapy and made it seem like everything was fine in the meantime and then in therapy dropped the bomb on me that he thinks we should live in separate apartments but not break up. \n\nSo essentially - I live close to my work and he lives close to his. Note that he doesn’t have a car and the closest train station is a 30-40 minute drive away from where I’d be. He doesn’t compromise in any way and I’m supposed to believe this isn’t a prelude to a breakup. \n\nI already feel like such a fool for having done this for almost 2 years because I thought we were building towards something together. \n\nThank you to everyone that commented on my previous post urging me to tackle this sooner rather than later. This monumentally sucks and I’ve been crying for hours (did I mention that my cat is going in for tests today to see if she has cancer? And this is the timing he chose to pull the rug out from under our relationship?) but at least now I know I guess. \n\nTLDR: I have a 2-3 hour daily commute which I’ve been doing for close to 2 years while boyfriend walks to work. Tensions have been rising due to distribution of chores and free time. I asked if we could move somewhere halfway between our respective workplaces when the lease is up in May and boyfriend opted instead to tell me to move out to my own apartment if I want to continue in this relationship.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you so much to everyone that has responded to this update post. My original post got a handful of comments and this update post blew up and I’ve been so touched by the kindness I’ve seen here. Even for those that said less than kind things - thank you too. I posted not for an echo chamber but to get all opinions and I appreciate the dissenting views as well. You have all given me a lot to think about and I’ll do my best to respond to everyone but please be patient with me as it may take me some time. \n\nAgain thank you :)",

      "body": "Previous: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/x51v9y/how_do_i_17f_tell_my_mom_36f_that_i_know_her_best/\n\nThere were way more replies than I could keep up with! For the day off today we decided to order dinner for takeout, and when my mom told me her order I asked her if I should put in an order for Kim as well. My mom asked why I thought Kim would be eating dinner with us, so I told her they hang out so much Kim is practically her girlfriend and I'm really happy for them both and they don't need to hide it from me.\n\nTurns out I was right about my mom dating a woman but wrong about it being Kim. About the same time she met Kim, she also met Jin at a professional conference of hers, and they've been dating for a few months now. My mom invited Jin over to dinner and it turns out they kept all their mushy stuff on my mom's smartphone, I knew they were friends but turns out half the time my mom's 'gone out to dinner with a friend' lately it's been Jin.\n\nMy mom hadn't told me for a few reasons. She grew up in a super conservative area and was kinda forced to marry my dad right after high school. She's not sure if she's bi or gay or has an exception or what, she's still working through a lot of stuff about how she feels and what she wants to call herself.\n\nShe also didn't want to tell me until I turned 18 because she's pretty sure my grandparents and aunts and uncles will disown her when she comes out, and make me choose. My mom wanted to wait until I was legally an adult and could make my own decisions about my relationships with my family. \n\nI hugged my mom and told her I don't give a shit what some hateful, miserable antediluvian cretins yammering from the primordial ooze say, she's my mom and she's awesome and I love her and Jin seems like a great woman. I told her that if the crabs in the bucket want to pull her back down, make crab cakes with rainbow sprinkles.\n\nJin laughed her head off but my mom asked me to please not say anything in public. She's working through personal shit and she'll come out in public when she's ready, so I promised I wouldn't say a word to anyone.\n\nExcept to you guys, there was so much awesome advice. Thank you, reddit!\n\nEDIT: To whom it concerns, 'Kim' and 'Jin' are of course not their real names, and I've fudged how long my mom's known these people for.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: right about my mom dating a woman, wrong about which woman, mom's working through personal stuff before she comes out publicly but knows I love and support her",

      "body": "TL:DR GF wouldn't talk to me after some unfortunate events that happened that resulted in her officially breaking up with me this past weekend (OCT 17)\n\nHere is the original post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my\\_34m\\_gf\\_26f\\_of\\_6\\_months\\_wont\\_talk\\_to\\_me\\_over\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my_34m_gf_26f_of_6_months_wont_talk_to_me_over_an/)\n\nNo one asked for the update, but I would like to say some things.\n\nWell, I was finally able to see her over the weekend for my and someone else's bday celebration, it wasn't a formal bday party, just hanging a friend's house during the day and going out later on. She basically ignored me at the friend's house and when I tried to get a minute to talk to her about what was going on, she wouldn't spare a few minutes to let me say my peace. But she did tell me she was pretty much done after the initial birthday incident a few weeks ago even though she kept telling me she didn't know how she felt or what she wanted yet. It's been a few days and the rose colored glasses are beginning to come off. I still think about her and want to be with her but it's getting better by the day. I've also started to try to remember certain things that bugged me about her in an attempt to help me move on because I've always had an issue with only remembering the good. Thank you all for you insights and advice, it helped me come to terms with the fact that she overreacted and wanted out anyway and this was just a good enough reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Wow! So many people have wished me luck and brought up some thoughts I've had as well. Thank you all so much for your insights and ideas.  Anytime I find myself thinking about/missing her, I will come back and read these comments to push me through.  Oh yeah, and thank you for the awards as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit #2:  Somebody asked in the comments what hobby she was trying to get into.  I play tennis recreationally and I'm not sure if she was trying to get better at it for me, but she mentioned it several times that she would like for us to go and play together.  She even got one of our friends who also plays tennis, to take her out and show her some drills she could use to help improve her game.  She texted me last night saying she had some things to say and clearly I do so could we call and talk sometime, I said sure just let me know.",

Strange behavior and circumstances makes me suspicious. Found pictures on facebook of him with a girl. Can't prove whether that girl is his \"ex\" or not. Looking for advice.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rdxxz/update_i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend/)\n\n**tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n\nAgain, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM. \n\nSo, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity. \n\nI wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to.\n\nOn Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home. \n\nOn Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it. \n\nThroughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either.\n\nSo, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again. \n\nI feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time. \n\nThanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it. \n\n**tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again. \n\n**quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them.",

      "body": "So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'.\n\nNearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him:\n\n* Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient.\n* Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore.\n* Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly).\n* Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me.\n* Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events.\n* Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them.\n\nThis list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts.\n\nLast night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority.\n\nHe then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say.\n\nHe is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things.\n\ntl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered.\n\nedit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.",

      "body": "Hi Guys, I am back with awesome news!\n\n\ntldr: We are engaged and everyone is doing better.\n\nMy old post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oeq0k/i_30m_was_planning_to_propose_to_my_girlfriend/\n\n\nOkay so in my last post my girlfriend was being very aggressive towards me about not proposing before her father passed away. She stayed relatively upset and cold towards me throughout the funeral, but afterwards it seemed like we started to get closer. That week was honestly living hell, having to go to a man I truly cared for's funeral, while his daughter is mad because she thinks i'm not proposing, all the while I am but cant tell her right now. It sucked\n\nHowever, time went on and things started to get better. Two weeks after the funeral, early November, I talked to her Mom and she helped me develop a new plan. I had convinced my girlfriend to take the whole week of Thanksgiving off, which wasn't hard because she knew the first holiday without her father would be really hard. So I took her on a surprise trip (which was our original mountain trip just later). Our plan was to leave Sunday evening and return Wednesday in time to help her family prep for Thanksgiving.\n\nSo I decided Sunday was my day. Her mom took her out all day to help her get ready for our little get away (aka distract her). I started setting up my proposal.\n\nI first took screenshots of all of the conversations her dad and I had via text about the engagement and printed them out. I was actually able to turn it into 15 individual screenshots of conversation. So I made them into a little book. I also included the picture I took with him the day I asked for his blessing and the two pictures i had of us three all together. \n\nI packed our bags for the trip and decorated the house in flowers and balloons so she'd know something was up as soon as she opened the door. When she opened the door she looked shocked and a little confused. Even more confused when I handed her a book and didn't get down on one knee. I had initially intended to get down on one knee while she read through our conversations but she started crying pretty hard and took the book to the couch in the living room, where I just kind of scooped her up in a hug and asked her to marry me. I had to awkwardly fish the ring out of my pocket and we didn't have the magical getting down on one knee moment, but through her tears she shook her head yes and hugged me, which I thought was even better than expected. \n\nOnce she regained her composer she told me how excited she was, but asked if i would mind if we waited til Monday morning to go to the mountains because she wants to show her mom and brother the book and ring. I didn't care at all and we ended up spending the night at her moms house. We left Monday and had an amazing trip to the mountains and we tried to hit all of her dads suggested proposal spots while we were there and snap pics (even though the weather was a lot colder than when our initial trip was planned) We had an amazing Thanksgiving with our families and now we cannot wait to start wedding planning.\n\nShe decided she no longer wants to get married next October and I obviously understood. Our wedding day is still TBD, but I couldn't be happier.",

      "body": "GF (28) wants full blown marriage and commitment from me (24) after only a year and a half.\n\nI’ve been seeing my gf since last November and I like her a lot. But she keeps escalating the relationship way faster than I feel comfortable. It started when I took out a lease on a bigger apartment last June and she just decided to move in with me, without even really asking. It’s been fine and I enjoy having her around. But then she took out a mortgage on a condo this October. I told her I thought things were moving too fast and she said, “Don’t worry, this has nothing to do with you.” I tried to tell her I didn’t want to move there because it’s way further from my job and I would need to buy a car to commute. She got upset and said I wasn’t committed enough to her.\n\nThe condo won’t be finished until December and I told her I’d think about it (which I have). But now it’s turned into her expecting me to help pay the mortgage, furnish the place out of my pocket, and go half and half on a car with her, none of which I agreed to. She also said she expects kids within 2 years, and that she’ll go to a sperm bank if I don’t want to do it.  I just tell her, “I’ll think about it,” to keep the peace. \n\nShe keeps making these huge life decisions and just expecting me to go along with her. Should I just break up with her? It would break my heart. I really do love her and the life we have together now, as is. But I don’t want a mortgage, or kids. \n\nI’ve never written any of this down before. The more I write the more insane I realize this is starting to sound. I’ve just never initiated a breakup before. It terrifies me and I have no idea how to go about it. I keep ruminating about it constantly. It’s driving me crazy. I need help.\n\nTL;DR \nGF is strong arming me into buying an apartment and having a kid with her way before I’m ready. I think I need to break up with her but I’m scared to.",

      "body": "**UPDATE: First, I want to thank each and every one of you who have given me advice, offered me an ear to rant/yell to or offered me a shoulder to cry on. After my first edit, many of you messaged me and asked me not to drink/that I was better than that/that this wasn't the thing to do. I sincerely appreciate that. My friend and his sister took me out to dinner to try to get my mind off of everything. At first, I wasn't really up to going, but I figured that it would be better to try to focus my mind on something different. My friends called up a couple of my other friends, and the 6 of us went out to dinner. At first, I wasn't really into it, I was kind of down, but my friends did anything and everything that they could to cheer me up. I can honestly say that I love my friends and everything that they've done for me.**\n\n**My best friend's sister (Emily) went through all the messages on my phone from the both of them and deleted anything that didn't need to be on there. She texted both of them from my phone telling them that it was her that was texting, and told her that a friend would be by at a certain time to pick up my stuff tomorrow, and she told him that I would be by tomorrow to grab some things and that I was going to try to get out of the lease by talking to my landlord.**\n\n**I want you all to know that I've read through each and every one of these comments, and that I've read through every message that's been sent to me on here. I plan on replying to a couple tonight or tomorrow (I'm really tired, but wanted to let you all know how much you've helped me).**\n\n**Finally, to the people that have been in the same position as I'm currently in, or to those that have been in a situation even relatively similar, I have a couple things. First, none of what your ex-SO did, says anything about you. It tells what kind of person THEY are; your reactions tell the kind of person that you are. Secondly, all of you are MUCH stronger than you realize. Many of you have given me such amazing advice, and you know exactly where I'm coming from. Talking about it isn't always the easiest, and many of you did to try to help an internet stranger, so thank you. Finally, many of you have much greater things to look forward to. Like one of old teachers said, \"it's like moving on to the next book in the sequence. Yeah, you may have to wait a little bit for the author to release it, but it's worth the wait.\"**\n\n**Also, to the kind individual that gave me gold, thank you. I plan on donating $5 tomorrow to a charity because of you. For anybody else that would like to, pick your favorite charity, and donate, or just do something nice for somebody else, it can have a huge impact on their life.**\n\n*EDIT: I'm at my best friends house. Him and his sister have been super awesome to me. Their doorbell rang about 5 minutes ago. It was her. His sister bitched her out. I wanted to go yell at her, but I started drinking fireball instead. It's going to be a long couple weeks until school gets out.*\n\nThrowaway, my girlfriend and roommate reddit.\n\nMy last class of the day was cancelled, so I decided to come home and surprise my girlfriend. I went to the store and grabbed everything to make her favorite meal (lasagna). I was carrying the bags up the stairs and put them down in front of the door to fish my keys out of my pocket and then I heard my girlfriend moaning.\n\nI thought that she was \"taking care of herself\" because I know that she likes to do that sometimes when I'm not around, so I didn't have a sudden \"ah-ha\" moment or anything. I walked in and there were her and my roommate on the couch.\n\nI opened the door and kind of just froze when I saw it. She looked up and me and he turned around and saw it was me, and I just saw red. As much as I wanted to, I didn't kick his ass. I just dropped the bags and walked away.\n\nAs I was getting into my car, they both came running out and yelling at me to stop, but I just floored it and got out of there as quickly as I could. I called my best friend and talked to him about it. He offered to come kick his ass, I told him no. I didn't want him to get in trouble from it.\n\nI even had the engagement ring that I planned to use to propose to her this summer when we went on vacation. It's in my safe that I keep in the closet, so I know that she doesn't know about it. But I planned to spend the REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER! Why didn't I see this coming?\n\nMy last class was supposed to start at 12, but since it was cancelled, I was home by 12.30. So it's been 4+ hours. My phone has been blowing up from both of them, I haven't looked at any of the messages or answered any of the calls.\n\nI called my bank and made sure that she wasn't on any of my accounts for anything. I'm going to go back later tonight and pack up all of her stuff and drop it off at her place tomorrow. Then I'll probably take a bag of clothes to my friend's house and stay there until school ends (3 weeks).\n\nWhat do I do next?\n   \n**tl;dr**: Found girlfriend having sex with my roommate. I left. Already made sure she wasn't on my bank accounts. Had no contact with either of them. Have a place to stay until school ends.",

Since then, it's just me and my little sisters, although I get help from our grandparents and aunt as well. It's not been easy but I think we're fine in general and we're all a happy family. I tend to get advice when I need it and this is when I need advice. \n\nWe live in a moderate place (not US), it's not the most liberal area but also not the most conservative area either. My sister came out as a lesbian last year and it's been a very smooth process actually. People close to us are generally very understanding and people who aren't really need no reason to be close to us. She hasn't had any problems at school about this until yesterday.\n\nShe's dating a girl (very nice girl, I know her parents) and apparently the sports coach noticed this. She asked if she's the girl who lives with her brother, and when my sister said yes, she basically said that \"poor you, things like this can happen when kids don't have proper parents\" in front of some other students. She was shocked and said her if she can elaborate. The coach said \"it's not your fault honey, when you don't have a mother figure shit like this happens. They shouldn't give hothead boys custody of teenage girls. A real family should have adopted you when your mom died.\"\n\nMy sister was angry and said in front of everyone that she should try to be a better mom herself before making comments about other people's parents, that they all know her daughter is a junkie and give guys blowjobs for a joint. She kicked my sister out of the sports class. I have confirmed that this is happened from a couple of her friends parents (that's exactly what my sister told me as well).\n\nI was planning to call the school today but they called me earliest thing in the morning themselves, asking me to come in person to discuss my sister's \"behavior\". I'm genuinely pissed off that a school staff made such a comment to my sister, let alone making comments about the quality of parenting that my sisters are receiving. I don't know how I should approach this issue. Any help is much appreciated.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Homophobic sport coach said my sister's homosexuality is because of \"lack of proper parents\". My sister said that her own daughter is a junkie and now the school wants to see me to talk about her behavior.",

So cheers for all the advice and all that stuff.\n\nI spoke to my mum's and told them I was thinking about not skateboarding again. They told me that's good because they're not letting me. There were a few suggestions that I ask them to come watch me. When I floated the idea, it was shot down immediately.  I went to my doctor and she told me that she doesn't want me skateboarding again. She expanded on my condition after the accident to me and told me another fall like that isn't going to go well for me. She said even after I get this thing off, I'm going to need to go to therapy to build strength again. \n\nMy mum gave my board to charity after we talked about it. I know they sound kinda mean, but they're really good mums. They're just very annoyed I did something very stupid. My girlfriend is annoyed me with me as well when she heard I heard I wanted to skate again. So overall I'm not skating anymore. \n\nTL;DR: I'm not skating anymore.",

It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that. \n\nInitially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing. \n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR My sister's friend shared my medical test results.

      "body": "Edit: Thank you so much for your advice and kind words! I don’t think I need any more advice for now. Will probably post an update at some point.  \nI think I will be meeting my sister to discuss this and probably avoiding him as much as I can. Also, I will try to clean my shoes again, and if that doesn’t work I will tell him to buy me another pair and that I won’t be tolerating his abusive behavior anymore.\n\nFor context: My sister (27F) is now pregnant with their 2nd child. Me and sis started really getting to know each other 4 years ago. Prior to that we didn’t really have any meaningful connection because of the age gap and other family issues. Her and BIL met and have been a couple for 5-6 years now, so he’s always been around. \n\nHe’s basically “the clown type” as I may say. He makes fun of everyone that’s not on his “superior  level” (even of my sis, calling her names when I’m around- she says she doesn’t mind). He also constantly makes fun of our father (because he’s very conservative) and jokes about him every time he gets the chance to.\n\nI’m really busy with school, but on a good month I’d probably hang out with them (at their place mostly) once a week. Me and my sis are getting along just great, have a lot to talk about and I love her a lot. \n\nEver since I met BIL he started making fun of me in a way that made me really sad, like “why are you so shy/ skinny/ sad? Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.” In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say “oh, I’m only joking, don’t be so sensitive”.\n\nFor a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- “you have Dumbo ears”, “your nose is like a skiing slope”, “you’re as fat as a cow” (I gained a little weight but nothing serious). I think I’m fairly good looking but his words really bring me down and I start questioning it. He also started pulling pranks on me- he painted my face pink when I was about to head to a party with my other sister, and because he is much heavier then me I couldn’t get away and had to redo all of my makeup.\n\nYesterday, I was hanging out with my other sister (18F) at their place. My BIL’s wife was at work and he came home to grab something. He enters the house and says “your belly looks like Jabba the Hutt when you laugh, you’re so fat OMG”. I didn’t say much thing back and just started packing my bag to head out. When I’m about to put on my shoes I notice he has written my dad’s name all over them in red marker. \n\nFor the first time ever, I got really mad and yelled at him. I told him that it is too much and very mean of him. So he started rubbing my shoes with alcohol and the writing is gone, but they’re still red from the marker and look like shit. I just grab them and tell him “I never want to see you again, I hate you” and left.\n\nWhen his wife found out, she texted me that she’s sorry for what he did- but I just didn’t reply. I’m so mad about it all. I still want to be around my sister (especially since she is pregnant and their other son always asks to see me +I love them so much). \n\nTL;DR: my BIL makes fun of me and has pulled a really bad “prank” on me. I still want to see my sister, but not him.",

      "body": "Alright so I married my husband (37M) about 6 months ago. He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years.\n\nThey got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her.\n\nAfter Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her.\n\nWe didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it. \n\nWe dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted.\n\nThen I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now.\n\nI am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this? \n\nTldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it.\n\nUPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said \"We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior.\" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life. I know it's a tough road to navigate, but I really appreciate brutal honesty, and advice.",

      "title": "Update: Am I [32F] being unreasonable with expectations of my husband’s [37M] parental and household responsibilities?",
      "body": "Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a63it9/am_i_32f_being_unreasonable_with_expectations_of/)\n\nMy original post didn’t get tons of attention but I figured I’d provide an update for those interested. \n\n**TL;DR:** I talked to my husband about how our household responsibilities are far from equally shared. He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well. \n\nAfter finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load. \n\nThis came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental “inventory” I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don’t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it’s not good for anyone. A kind of “emergency” situation would arise. \n\nIf my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part. \n\nAfter explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his “radar” for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn’t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better. \n\nHe also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he’s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn’t require me asking. \n\nIn the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do “Does not go unnoticed” and that he is so thankful for all that I do. \n\nIt feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here’s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :)",

      "body": "**[Original post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4infj1/me_36f_with_my_ex_boyfriend_36m_of_over_10_years/) - tl;dr: I think my ex boyfriend is being emotionally manipulated by his wife who is alienating him from friends and family. I want to help him but don't know how.**\n\nHi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks!\n\nSo I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it.\n\nThankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family.\n\nMy husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype \"consult\". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard.\n\nThey scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home!\n\nBill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep.\n\nI don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as \"personal development\" because there are still decent people in the world.\n\n**tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**",

      "body": "Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/434ot4/i_25m_won_2_tickets_to_the_super_bowl_my/\n\nThanks everyone for the advice. It was very helpful. This was a very stressful and long few days. I'm just glad there seems to be a resolution. I had tried talking to my girlfriend and she was still clearly upset. I approached the conversation as many people said keeping an understanding that she was more disappointed than controlling and would come around. Unfortunately she was being unreasonable. She said \"I could go\" but that doing so would hurt her a great deal and that she would need some time to reevaluate things. I should have just ended things with her there but I was so sick of these tickets by this point that I didn't even have the heart to go even if I did decide to end things with her. As suggested by some of the comments here, I called up the radio station and asked if it was at all possible to transfer the tickets to my brother so he could go with his wife. They were totally understanding and awesome about it and said they were sorry I couldn't go but they were glad to put the tickets in my brothers name for me. I was just glad to have it behind me at that point. \n\nI told my girlfriend what I did and that I was staying here and she said that I was \"being dramatic\" and \"immature.\" She said that I transferred the tickets to my brother just so I could \"win\" the argument and look like a martyr. It was at this point I reached my breaking point. I calmly told her this relationship was over. I wasn't even mad at this point just confused that a person I thought I knew could act this way. She said she was gonna break up with me because of the way I handled this anyway so breaking up with her \"didn't matter.\" \n\nMy brother immediately told me I dodged a bullet and glad that she was out of everyone's lives. My brother's wife was totally cool about me using her ticket and didn't even question it even after I'm technically taking back my gift to her. They insisted that I go with my brother and it was their idea. So now I'm the guest of my original tickets that I won. Happy to say I arrived in SF a few days ago and am having the time of my life. My girlfriend didn't unfollow me on social media and I'm posting as many pictures as I possibly can. Thanks everyone!\n\ntl;dr - Transfered tickets to my brother. Girlfriend was still petulant and we broke up. Got to go on the trip with my brother anyway.",

I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going.

      "body": "UPDATE TO http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36618q/i_found_out_my_boyfriends_19m_surprise_present_to/\n\nWell, I've had an eventful 24 hours.\n\nSo to recap: on the 16th, my best friend Sara, who is friends with my boyfriend Alex, decided to warn me that my boyfriend was going to take me skydiving for my birthday, to which I completely freaked out about.\n\nSo I read through everyone's responses. Towards the end I was watching videos of first time skydivers over and over again, trying to psych myself up to do it, since I decided I'd probably regret it if I didn't go (even if I had a panic attack on the way there.)\n\nAlex came over the night I posted––I didn't mention the skydiving to him exactly, but I did reiterate and try to explain how bad my fear of heights was––and he was acting rather odd about it. He understood it completely, but just smiled and said, \"Don't worry about it, we'll get through it together.\"\n\nHe then took a really quick exit. I tried getting in touch with Sara, but she wasn't picking up her phone; she just texted me to come over at night.\n\nSo later that evening (on the 17th, the day before my birthday) I went over to Sara's, who lives in the same building as me. A few of my girlfriends/future flatmates were there. We chilled for a while, I talked about how terrified I was to skydive but that I'd decided I would give it a try. Sara had a weird, half-amused look on her face, and just replied, \"Oh it'll be over soon! He just wants to help you get over your fear!\"\n\nThen around 11 PM I got a random text from Alex telling me he was coming over. He came over to Sara's and the two of them couldn't stop giggling. At midnight on the 18th they both wished me a happy birthday… then Alex said, \"So, Sara told me you already know what I'm going to get you.\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"Yeah?\"\n\nAnd then Alex said, \"Well, in about eight days, we're going skydiving from the highest drop in Europe.\"\n\nI started visibly freaking out at this point. Alex and Sara burst into laughter. Then Sara said, \"Fuck, I can't keep this up anymore, I feel so bad. We're joking. We wanted to scare you!\"\n\nAlex grabbed my hand and he said, \"Of course I wouldn't take you skydiving! I don't want to kill you! We just really wanted to fuck with you since we knew you were catching onto us… Your real present is around the corner.\"\n\nSo I looked around the corner and there was a fishtank, all set up with a couple exotic fish, a heater, and a filter (just like I wanted)! My babies are safe and sound and I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane, reddit!\n\nHe apologised profusely and said (since a few days earlier I was beginning to to catch onto the idea that they were getting me fish) that he wanted to make sure my present was a surprise and that he had no idea how deep my fear was. He said he was extremely sorry he'd ever caused me to freak out like that, but that he was never planning on taking me skydiving.\n\nNow Alex is taking me to the Natural History Museum and we're gonna go for bubble tea and pancakes. I'm thrilled to pieces. This has been a really good birthday.\n\n**TL;DR: I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane. Instead I get adorable fish. I love my life.**",

      "body": "My husband \"Nick\" was married to his first wife \"Vanessa\" for 5 years and they had two amazing kids, \"Luke\" (15/M) and \"Lila\" (13/F). Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. \n\nAfter 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. \n\nI have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son \"Casey\" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. \n\nBut Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. \n\nLast week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's \"real\" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd \"keep busy and leave him alone.\"\n\nI'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him. \n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids. Any advice is desperately needed right now.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My husband has been distant and ignoring our kids. When I confronted him, he told me he wished I had died instead of his first wife and that I'm only half the mother she was. I'm currently pregnant and not sure how to fix this or us.",

      "body": "Hi all. \n\nI'm a law student, and met my boyfriend Tom through mutual friends around the start of our first year. We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education. \n\nIn Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''. \n\nAnyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''. I was a bit hurt and Tom was confused, but neither of us thought much of it. \n\nAnyway, we didn't deal with her again until a month or so later when Tom's flatmates left the place to him so he invited me over. We were watching a movie when Tom got a call from Isabel, who was crying, saying she'd been kicked out of a club for being stoned and it was nearby his place, asking if she could stay the night until the morning. Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there. \n\nWhen she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her. \n\nEver since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out. \n\nEver since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming. He swore at her and blocked her on everything. \n\nThat's good, but when we go back to uni she's still going to be around. Her and her friends frequent most of the places we go to, and she's still in his class. What's going to stop her from bothering him again? He's said he wants nothing to do with her, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way. \n\nTL;DR: A girl from my boyfriends class acted unpleasantly to me and then tried to break us up, before sending him pictures last night.",

I found it kind of annoying at first, but the last couple years she's been happier than I ever remember my mom being. They go out to dinner once a week, they talk and text a lot, etc. \n\nEarlier this week I had to fix a software problem on my mom's computer and I opened her browser history and saw a page about having safe sex for two women. All of a sudden everything clicked. My mom working late hours at work a lot recently, my mom hiding her laundry from me, things like that.\n\nI want to tell my mom that I'm really happy for her that she has a girlfriend and she doesn't have to hide it from me, but I feel like going 'Hey mom, I know you're munching Kim's rug' wouldn't be good. \n\nAdvice?\n\n[UPDATE]: Lots of really good advice! We both have Monday off so I'll come up with something to say to her then.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Pretty sure my mom's 'best friend' is her girlfriend, how do I tell her I know and she doesn't need to hide?",

Of course things were better for a while...at some point I decided to stick it out until my kids were grown because I was afraid that having them in a visitation arrangement would be mentally damaging to them. That's his big issue, he is verbally abusive and controlling. I'm an independent, successful person and I am also  financially independent. I  have been able to keep him \"in check\" so to speak in regard to the kids most of the time because I simply won't tolerate his attempts to control them. That's not to say he has not habitually made our oldest feel less than or like he is a disappointment. Both of our kids are well adjusted, bright, motivated and loving. But, if they don't measure up in some way, his reaction is unbelievably harsh. He says hurtful things to the kids and they have both, at times, broken down crying about his treatment of them. All he cares about is \"his money\" and doesn't even want to help our kids with college. There's more, I could go on but, the question is, do I try counseling? My concern is that it's just a ploy to pull me back in. I begged him for years to go and he refused.\n\nTl;dr My (F47) husband (M48) finally wants to try counseling now that our youngest will be leaving for college and I am planning to leave.",

I had taken a few pictures from my sister that night and emailed them those pictures as well. They were pissed off and angry at him and my mom for not standing up for us. They told me to stay upstairs and don't apologise and they will come over on Sunday morning. So we did that. My mom came to talk to us again on Saturday evening, insisted that we can go apologise and we can all forget that it happened, but we kept refusing until she gave up. Later that night my mom came back up to talk to me again and wanted me to end this \"rebellion\" as she put it, saying that it won't lead to anything good and it just makes things worse. I told her that I'm just protecting sister. She said \"it's my job not yours\". I said \"clearly you're not doing it well enough so I'm gonna have to do it\". She gave up again. \n\nSo grandparents came over on Sunday morning. Mom and step father were home as well. We were upstairs and couldn't hear what they were saying but I could hear that my grandparents were very angry. I don't know what happened but after a while my mom came up and asked us to come down. We went down and Stap-father apologised to my sister and said it won't happen again and that he will make it up to us. My grandfather told me to let him know ASAP if something like this happened again.\n\nAfter they left my mom looked very angry at me but didn't say anything.\n\nP.S. I didn't call the police in the end. I was afraid to make the situation worse and make a much larger mess. I though involving grandparents is enough and they know better whether to call the police or not.\n   \n**tl;dr**: I called grandparnets. They came over and talked to them.

It struck a chord deep in me with how many outsiders had such a different perspective on the issue, where I thought I wasn’t being firm enough and my friends were just ignorant in terms of the ramifications of their actions, whereas the vast majority of commentators thought they were just plain assholes and racists. I guess I was hoping if I was simply firm in my resolve, and told them in no uncertain terms if their disrespectful behavior were to continue we could no longer continue socializing, they would see the error in their ways and hopefully apologize to my wife. \n\nSo yesterday, I asked them if we could all meet up to discuss something important, and after work we all went for drinks. Once we started talking, I told them how disrespectful they were being towards both my wife and I, and addressed how much it had hurt my wife to be made fun of just because of her accent and ignorance when it comes to American customs. I continued by saying that I understand we usually joke about these sorts of topics, such as race, but that I now realized how wrong it was and it all needed to stop. They did not take me seriously at all. Immediately everyone began commenting on how much of a “bitch” I’d become since getting married, and I was always so prissy and sensitive about shit we’d used to laugh about all the time. They continued by saying I never enjoyed myself anymore, and how I’d basically abandoned our group because I was always spending time with my wife. I was constantly trying to respond, or defend myself, but the fuckers kept interrupting me and wouldn’t let me say anything. They also said I stopped partying like I used to, like what the fuck? Sorry I’m not interested in getting shitfaced at the club every Friday night, we’re not in college anymore. Then one of the guys says, “Are you being all uptight because you’re not getting laid anymore? I’m surprised man, if my wife was as hot as (my wife’s name) I’d be banging the shit out her everyday.” Then all of them fucking laughed like he’d made a hilarious joke instead of being a massive douche bag. After that I was done with them, and told them they I no longer wanted to socialize with people who were being completely disrespectful and held bigoted attitudes towards my wife, then left. \n\nOnce I got home, my wife immediately asked what was wrong. I suppose I must’ve still looked pissed off over what transpired.  I told her how sorry I was over the way I handled the situation, and she would no longer have to deal with their mocking and bullying. She looked extremely guilty that I said this, and told me I didn’t have to sacrifice my happiness and friendships just to please her, and I should continue hanging out with them if I really wanted to. I don’t know, I’m kind of embarrassed to admit it but I started crying like a baby. This women, who’d left everything behind, her life, family, friends, to travel halfway across the world to a completely different country all on the promise that I would provide her with a better life, thought this entire situation was her fault, and was saying I should prioritize my happiness over her own feelings or well-being. It broke me, and made me realize what a selfish prick I was. So I spent over an hour convincing her this wasn’t her fault at all, and that she should never believe my feelings are more important than her’s, and whenever she is feeling hurt, or angry, she should express those feelings without ever thinking it was wrong to do so. I’m very saddened by how long I had allowed this to transpire, and have a ton of making up to do. \n\nAlso, I just wanted to express my thanks reddit. This was the main reason I posted an update, your guys’ comments really helped take the wool off my eyes and understand the reality of the situation. We’re in a much better place now because of it, and I truly do appreciate everything, thank you. \n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Got rid of my friends, you were right they are bunch of assholes",

My husband told me not to worry about it and he would look after him. Once we were done at the doctor I went to go visit my sister for a little bit with my daughter. \n\nBoth our children are perfectly healthy, my daughter just had this cough that kept getting worse so I took her to the doctor. She's getting better now. But last night I got a E-Mail from a woman yesterday evening. I had just put the kids to bed and I was working. \n\nThe title read \"Concern over your son\" It caught my eye, because I was thinking who is this and why is she talking about my kid. This woman Ember [fake name] claimed to know my husband. Not only that she claimed to be sleeping with my husband and that they were in love. \n\nShe messaged me to tell me that she was over at my house last week. The day I took my daughter to the doctor, she even mentioned this in the Email. She told me my son was wondering around while my husband and I quote \"fucked my brains out in your bed\" She told me to take my son with me when I go out so they can have some privacy. The things I wanted to do to her when I read it, hell would reserve a special section just for me. \n\nI was furious and I asked my husband who was watching TV who is Ember. The look on his face said it all, you could just tell his heart sank and he was shitting himself. He was stuttering, and was telling me she's nobody. A long argument later he told me to \"go fuck myself and left\"\n\nHe called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason.\n\nI don't know what to do next, I am still in shock, I'm angry, I need some guidance.

I work 4AM-8PM Monday through Friday. I get paid for driving, so the 2 hour commute to and from work is included in those hours, not on top of them. I don’t work for any school - my company is a contractor with many different schools. It is illegal to make employees work so many hours where I live, but most of the people who work here either don’t care because the money is so good or they quit early on. I don’t want to say what I do specifically because from there it would be easy to find out what company I work for which I imagine could get me in legal trouble.\n\nI didn’t want to call my doctor yesterday because I was afraid to leave work and because I didn’t want my coworkers or anyone at the school to hear what was going on. However, I ended up doing so because I noticed there was a teacher with my last name (which is also my dad’s, and is quite rare unlike the girlfriend’s common name) and I panicked a little. I excused myself to the bathroom and called my doctor, who advised me to come in, and then I told me coworkers I had to leave because of a medical emergency.\n\nI was not medicated before, but I have now started a new medication which will hopefully work. I have some mental exercises that I used the one other time I have had a really bad delusion like this (I thought my house was infested with fleas but they were really just on the dog) and they’re helping to ground me. I think I am afraid of my dad trying to get back into my life (he does this every so often) which is why I jumped straight to thinking it was his ex stalking me, and my doctor agrees.\n\nI also have put in my two weeks notice at work. I have enough money to get by for the next few months if I can’t get another job right away, and this job is destroying me physically and mentally.\n\nI did also buy a CO detector but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I also live with my fiancé who is not having similar symptoms.\n\nThank you to everyone who replied to the original post. I’m sorry I worried you.\n\ntl;dr I’m not being stalked, I’m just crazy",

      "body": "I'm kind of a moron sometimes when it comes to being aware of my wife's sensitivities. But I love her so much, and she loves me, so it's seriously bothering me that I screwed up. She is the best wife a man could ask for. We've been married for 4 years. She gave birth to our second child a few months ago. As you would expect we've been quite emotionally attached to one another during her pregnancy and after she gave me our second son, but when I offended her a week ago she has sulked and ignored me as much as possible.\n\nI rush home from work like I have been doing, eager to see my wife and our sons, but now she says \"you're dinner's on the table\" and she leaves me alone to eat while playing with our son and holding the baby. We've always had a ritual that has been extremely important to me: I get home from work and we make out for about 5 minutes, act all lovey-dovey, then we eat together with the boy(s). It's been devastating for her to abruptly change like this.\n\nSo here's the stupid thing I did. When we married she was very skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot). Since having the first child she has steadily gained weight and become a little plump. Her body definitely has changed and she's not looking skinny and petite. But she's still just as beautiful and this has never been something I've seen in a negative light. But this was apparently devastating to her self-esteem, to an extent that I wouldn't have imagined. I've always told her when we're intimate or she's getting changed near me that she's so beautiful. In fact as she's gained some weight I've said it more and I can sometimes barely keep my hands off her when we're alone and she's changing or something. Yet she's always responded to this by saying \"she's gotten so fat\", \"I'm hideous\", \"I'm sure not what you signed up for am I\", and all that crap. One night I said the wrong thing (though I didn't know it would be when I said it): I kissed her thighs and said \"your curves have gotten so amazing\" and she just flipped out and started crying, saying \"so now you're just acknowledging how fat I've gotten out loud\" and she's been seeming sulky ever since.\n\nWhen I told her that she's not \"fat\", that she's just as beautiful as before and actually more so, she just gets more upset. How do I fix this stupid mistake I made? I love my wife more than anything, and she's never gotten this upset or sulky before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr My wife has gained some weight since having our 2 kids. I didn't realize how serious it was to her, and I commented about how \"sexy her curves have gotten\". She flipped out, cried, said that now I'm finally telling her \"how fat she's gotten while giving me 2 sons\". My life revolves around my wife, our daily affectionate rituals are gone, and she sulks a lot. I don't know how to fix it and make it up to her when she's so hurt and upset over this.**",

I love it when he wears it down and it’s clean. The problem is, he never wears it down and despite me trying to show him different things like conditioners and product and how to brush it, he’s never had long hair so he’s not used to the effort it takes to maintain. He doesn’t seem interested in learning, either. He washes it with soap and sometimes goes days without washing it at all, so he transforms from Jason Momoa into Ed from 90 day fiancé really quickly. It’s always tied back into a greasy, stringy ponytail, and he wears it in a high pony which I hate because it makes him look like a cheerleader. He also uses my bright pink scrunchies and bows when we are around the house because it’s convenient, and also because he thinks it’s funny, but I don’t find it attractive at all. I also don’t want to use my brush and my hair ties anymore after he does just because his hair is so nasty. Imagine if Jojo siwa didn’t wash her hair for five days. That’s what I’m married to. \n\nHow do I go about this? I don’t really want to hurt his feelings, but the little hints I’ve been dropping like trying to show him how to take care of his hair have not been working. I’m starting to resent his total lack of effort into his appearance. It’s  one thing to not comb your hair one day or just stay in your pajamas, but his hair is just straight up gross and I cannot take it anymore. \n\nTl;dr: husband grew out his hair when covid happened, has no interest in cutting it now that things are opening up, but refuses to take cake of his hair and I think it’s gross. How do you confront a partner about their hygiene and appearance when they let themselves go?\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your suggestions. I don’t have time to answer everyone individually tonight, but the consensus seems to be that the time for sparing feelings has passed and a blunt conversation is the best way to go. I’m going to reread all your responses and put together what I want to say and give it a go. If it doesn’t go well, then I’ll take the advice of the one redditor who suggested I cut it off while he was sleeping.\n\nEdit #2: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. calm down folks, I’m not going to actually cut his hair while he’s sleeping, that was a joke. I might spray it with dry shampoo though.",

I have been with my boyfriend through his drug addiction, his university failures, him changing into a new university, etc.\n\nFor the past month, my boyfriend, Nick, has been hanging out with my best friend, Emily. They text, they share memes and she knows about him as much as I do, if not more. I am not an overly jealous person but it did make me uncomfortable when I realized that they had been spending hours together, just the two of them. Obviously I confronted them about it and both of them reassured me that it was nothing. During this time he also started bringing up things like, \"he needs his freedom and his independence and focus on his career,\" despite knowing I have been very supportive of his decision to change degrees and have been with him throughout the process and would not come in between him and his career. Recently my boyfriend told me that he felt very stressed in school and needed time to focus on it and wasn't sure if he could put enough effort into our relationship and I told him we could take a break, while he figured out what he wanted. Despite the break (where we agreed to not date other people) we still hung out and there wasn’t any bad blood.\n\nBut yesterday at my best friend's birthday party while I was inside, a friend of mine comes to tell me that Emily has her legs on Nick's lap and he's been massaging her upper thighs and whatnot.

I saw them sitting very close to one another, with his hand far up her thighs and the moment he saw me, he pulled back like he'd been burned. It was so awkward for me as we’d just been out together a day before and Nick gave me the vibes that our break was really temporary.\n\nI confronted them after the party and my boyfriend kept bringing the whole \"freedom\" and \"independence\" thing and I broke up with him for real there because it was a little too much to deal with. I told my best friend, she has hurt me immensely and I left. My bf still stayed at her place after but apparently, nothing happened in between them. Anyway, the next day Emily calls me and she apologized to me, telling me she didn't realize it was such a huge thing and they were just being playful. She then proceeded to tell me that Nick told her he has fallen for her, she again reassured me that I mattered to her most and that she wasn't going to be in contact with Nick anymore because she doesn't like him and I know that is true because he is not her type. But I know that she loves attention, no matter if she's into the guy or not. I don't completely trust her because she did lead him on, knowing how that would make me feel. She kept on promising me that she won't talk to him anymore that she loves me, but honestly, their behaviour have really broken my trust on them. \n\nAs for my boyfriend, I haven't been texting him because he knowingly hurt me, was dishonest to me, despite all the things I've done for him. He still insisted that his school is really affecting him and is the priority, but it's difficult to trust him after his actions. I blame him more as he was definitely aware of what was happening. I feel heavily exhausted and drained because of this and I would really appreciate some advice to help get me back up on my feet as I did not realize how bad this would hurt. I managed to keep my self-respect and calm in front of them, but it really hurt me from within. \n\n\\[TL;DR: Boyfriend tells my best friend that he's fallen for her, and I need to know if I should trust either one of them anymore.\\]\n\nEdit: to everyone who’s telling he’s not my boyfriend and I shouldn’t refer to him, I know and I agree. I also wrote this post like a day after all the incidents happened and I was so used to referring him that way that it came out on it’s own.\n\nUpdate: thank you to everyone for their responses, since posting this, I’ve realised that they are still very immature and need to grow into their own. Some experiences in my childhood and initial adult years definitely helped me with my calmness and understanding in this situation. For now, I would break contact and let them become their own individuals and its good if they learn and grow from this. Thank you for everyone who commented, once I actually realised that it wasn’t me, my whole outlook changed and I do believe that all these comments really helped with understanding that, so thank you.",

      "body": "Warning, wall of text - but suffice to say this isn't your typical MIL move in post.\n\nMy wife and MIL have a toxic relationship. Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died. \n\nDespite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months.\n\nHow did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years.\n\nOne of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it.\n\nFast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom. \n\nOf course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us.\n\nThis is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person. This isn't just my opinion, I've sat in my wife's therapy sessions and heard her say all these things about MIL.\n\nMy wife knows how terrible she is, how much I dislike her (but don't show it to MIL) but I  understand how my wife has to do this. Any tips on making it work? I honestly don't want to be at my home.  I'd rather work late, travel more and be out of that place. I love my wife and kids and would miss them terribly but MIL makes me miserable and my wife miserable abd she lashes out at me and the kids. Gonna try to suck it up and deal with it but the future isn't bright \n\nTL;DR: horrible MIL moving in for foreseeable future, I'd rather go get my own place, need coping tips",

      "body": "Original here:\n\nhttps://nr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mb7li/how_do_i_32_mtf_say_thank_you_to_my_foster/\n\nSorry for not responding to any of the original comments. Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice. \n\nI did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own.\n\nI took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc. \n\nI ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well. \n\nI would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished.\n\nI didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture!\n\nI gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person. \n\nThis has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here! This was seriously an amazing experience. \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Crafts, adoption and electrolyte replacements.",

      "body": "Original\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48ln18/i_27m_want_to_marry_my_gf_25f_of_4_years_but_im/\n\nBefore I update, I just want to thank everyone. It was nice to see that not everyone called me a selfish a.hole and actually gave me great points to consider. \n\n\nI took the advice about making spreadsheets and discussing having separate accounts for things such as \"disposable savings\" \"bills\" \"emergencies/if one of us loses income/accidents\" \"holidays\" \"college found\" etc \n\nI sat Tara down yesterday after a nice day out with our dogs and told her I'd like to discuss finances and our future and asked her how she felt about things. \n\n\nI tried to be as respectful as I could, and I told her that while I respect her need to take care of her family, i wanted us to be prepared so that we weren't left in a dangerous situation ourselves, especially if we want kids, we should consider what would happen if one of us or both dies, or accidents/illnesses. \n\n\nShe was actually very open about it all and agreed with most of it. She said although she doesn't keep separate accounts for everything, she has a set % in mind when helping her family. \n\n\nI knew she had savings set aside for emergencies and also for a house but what I didn't know was that she has started saving for her siblings tuition - a very decent amount)  She has been saving a lot more than I thought she did. I'm still amazed at how she was able to save so much. She showed me her accounts and needless to say I was embarrassed for thinking she would give away all her savings, I should of known she was smarter than that.  \n\n\nI also discussed what would happen if she thought we didn't need something but we wanted it, and consider several scenarios. She wants to travel the world with me so she's fine with that as long as I don't exaggerate with expensive champagne and caviar  for breakfast she's fine with us indulging a little. \n\n\nShe is against wasting money though, so she made it clear she won't be buying expensive brands herself but said she won't tell me off for the things I do, which is fine with me. \n\n\nThe only thing she said would annoy her is if I ever bought an expensive car (100k +) She thinks they're a waste as most lose value pretty fast which is fair enough. \n\n\nThe other issue about messiness, \n\n\nShe actually offered a chore list and asked if I wanted to cook or clean, I'm actually hopeless at cooking and she is the best cook I've ever met so we decided she would cook and I'll help with the cleaning. She doesn't mind getting extra help (cleaner) from time to time as well since we will both be pretty busy\n\n\nWe also decided to have separate wardrobes so that she can chuck her stuff in without messing with mine lol \n\n\nAll in all things are looking good, I now have to plan the proposal, can't wait to start my life with this amazing woman. Thanks everyone \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr; talked with my lady, she's more amazing then I realized.",

      "body": "Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/\n\nFirst, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.\n\nSo, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.\n\nThe update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.\n\nMy inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would \"fix this\".\n\nI opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.\n\nI opened a new credit card in my name.\n\nMy mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.\n\nI met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to \"talk\".\n\nOn the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.\n\nI pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to \"erase\" us.\n\nKeep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.\n\nWe have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.\n\nMy goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.\n\nI also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.\n\nSo, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.",

I absolutely understand his need to game, it's his downtime and I would never ask him to stop altogether. However we haven't gone to bed together in over 2 years, he stays up till 3/4am every night gaming. I can't get any sleep, it's a small house so all I can hear is the clicking of the mechanical keyboard and him talking to the others online. He'll sleep till 12/1pm on the weekends, he games for most of the day and night, thinks spending an hour or 2 with me after I make dinner is 'quality time' (it really isn't). I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to limit his gaming time.  I'm stuck doing all of the household chores while working full time and running my own business (a bakery). I love alone time as much as the next person but I feel so lonely as we can't do anything together because his world revolves around it. I have tried every approach and he won't budge. He turns it around on me saying that I'm being controlling, needy and that I'm changing him which I'm absolutely not, I have never asked him to stop and would never. He does work so I understand the need to escape and have time alone. Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nTL;DR Husbad games all night, refuses to see it may be a problem in our marriage",

      "body": "\\*\\*EDIT: Wow, I had no idea that this would get as much traction as it has. I wish I could go and thank each of you for your thoughtful comments, but time isn't really something I have a ton of right now ;) And for those of you who said you relate, might I encourage reading \"Boundaries\" by Cloud & Townsend. Obviously this is still a huge struggle for me, but I'm thankful for the example others who have figured it out can set for us \"people pleasers\".\n\nOne of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's \"busy\", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave.\n\nThe party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan.\n\nOriginally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say?\n\nTL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say.",

      "body": "Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates.\n\n[Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/)\n\nSo, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: \"How would you feel if I stopped working?\" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of \"If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?\"\n\nI wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead.\n\nI've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day.\n\nWake up in the morning and he says \"...don't you have work today?\" and I'd be like \"Eh, I don't feel like it\".  The first few days he was like \"Awesome!\" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like \"So...what's up with work?\" and I tell him \"Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it\".  After the second week he says \"What's going on?!\" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to \"the machine\" either, so I'll just stay here with him.  \n\nHe FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks.\n\nI kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah.\n\nAnyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event.\n\nI'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p\n\nAnyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!\n\n\n**tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again.\n\nEdit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual \"reaction\", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a \"what's good for the goose...\" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was.\n\nBasically...to this day he still believes he's \"right\", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really.",

      "body": "My husbands parents have a ton of money. I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - - How do I get my husband to accept the money his parents are offering us? We are in debt and both unemployed and our kid has health issues, and he is refusing to take their offer.",

      "body": "[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b47frm/friend_37f_is_about_to_be_turneddown_for_a/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLordy. Where do I begin. I need more help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his \"followers\". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't \"see\" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like \"enough is enough\" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr the new guy started and the hype was real. he's been great but Tina took rejection so badly that I'm worried she's going to be fired. I'm not sure how to handle this. She's going to get fired if she doesn't stop complaining and people want me to speak with her.",

      "body": "**TL;DR: The girl my ex cheated on me with randomly messaged me a couple months back, turns out she was pregnant! Kind of got closure, am very happy.**\n\nLink to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mb89u/girl_20sf_who_my_23f_ex_23m_cheated_on_me_with/\n\nHi all, my initial post didn't garner much attention, but I wanted to give a short update.\n\nI never responded back to Jessica and basically told her that while I understood she was guilty there really isn't anything she can and should do for me. Just that she has to make better decisions now and hopefully her guilt would mean she wouldn't hurt another person like that again. \n\nDuring the Holidays, my ex's dad greeted me a Merry Christmas. I was also told of the news that Jessica was 4-5 months pregnant with my ex's child. :O It lines up now, and I guess that's why she messaged me, because they found out around that time. Just wish she was really sorry lmao. \n\nAfter that my ex and I had the chance to talk. While of course I was still not ok with the fact that he cheated on me, I wouldn't wish ill on an unborn child. He has a lot of growing up to do, and is not the most financially stable person. It also turns out the girl is quite young. I told him that I wished him well despite everything. His dad told me that he still believes he can make something of himself. \n\nWhen my ex and I talked, he admitted to me that the reason he cheated was because he knew I was already going to break up with him. This is partly true because months before, I sat him down and talked to him about issues in our relationship, and I had wanted to bring his attention to the fact that things really were no longer healthy. I guess it was my prelude to an amicable break-up. He told me that there really was a better way to break things off, but that he was too scared to be alone after breaking up. So he made sure he had someone to run to when we finally broke things off. I just really wish we could have ended things better, he was my best friend. \n\nThe news shocked me, but in a way I guess I was able to get closure. I'm currently in a good and healthy relationship and starting the year with a really great outlook.  \n\nThank you all for the advice! I wish everyone had a great holiday!\n\n**EDIT:** Oh wow, I really wasn't expecting this to blow up! I thought my post was locked but glad I checked. I was sick last night and only had the chance to see it now!\n\nJust a few clarifications because a lot of people have questions. I'm sorry I wasn't too clear on the details, as I didn't want to submit such a lengthy post. I realized after re-reading my post how confusing I was! My apologies :)\n\nFirst is that yes, I did respond back to Jessica (the message I detailed in this post) ~~before~~ after (sorry I made a mistake!) the reddit post, but she responded again. I no longer messaged back after, hope that's clear.\n\nYou are all correct, based on the timeline she did get pregnant after we broke up/I discovered his cheating. What I didn't mention or was fully clear with yet is, around 4 or 5 months ago, my ex talked to me and told me that she and Jessica broke up, because they realized that they were in a relationship for the wrong reason. We talked for closure, but I realize now he was also testing the waters with me. I could be wrong tho! \n\nThere are a number of people who also question why I kept in contact with people in my ex's life, or why I even talked to him after everything. I agree that it isn't the most healthy or mature, and I call myself out on that a lot of times. It was just really hard to detach from his family, who I grew close to. When my ex's dad last talked to me, he told me that things will never change and he still loves me like a daughter. :') And while a lot of people don't agree with my last communication with my ex, I think it was helpful for both of us in the process of moving forward. I think we left the conversation clearing out that we don't have hate for each other, just wishing each other well. \n\nAlso, I have to admit that I don't have the most positive image of Jessica, and I watch myself a lot of times not to be hateful. It's hard to judge when you only have the negative things shown to you. She did a lot of hurtful things to me (outside the cheating), but in the grand scheme of things, I really don't know the full story anyway. With how the chips fell, I think all I can do now is wish them the best. \n\n2018 was a tough year. Went through a break-up, was cheated on, lost my sister, had to re-contact my ex to get things my sister used to own back (these are the things I referenced to in my initial post), and basically had to pull myself back up after all the pain and losses. \n\nBut I am glad to leave it all behind in 2018, and I am starting 2019 strong!\n\nThank you for all the positivity and warm wishes everyone! To a healthy year of growth ahead! :)",

      "body": "Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95u8md/should\\_i\\_33f\\_tell\\_my\\_exs\\_28m\\_girlfriend\\_that\\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95u8md/should_i_33f_tell_my_exs_28m_girlfriend_that_he/)\n\nOriginal post TL;DR - Dumped ex for cheating. His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They’re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I’m not interested, but should I tell her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Sorry for the delayed update for anyone that was interested, but I moved and life has been hectic. I read every comment on the original post and considered every option. A couple weeks after my ex initially contacted me via email, he sent me a text message asking if I would ever talk to him again. Like before, I didn't respond. A couple days after I moved, I messaged his gf/the previous \"other woman\" on Facebook since that was my only form of contact with her. I first asked if they were together, to which she responded \"yes\" a couple days later. In a brief conversation I told her that I felt I owed her the courtesy since she once extended the same to me. I told her he had contacted me twice in the last month and gave her the gist of his email. She said she figured that's why I was contacting her, said she really appreciated me telling her, thanked me, and said she hoped I was doing well. I told her good luck and went on my merry way. No catfighting, no unnecessary chatting. \n\nIn the end, I feel bad for her. Yeah, she made the horrible decision to get back with him but I'm sure she did hoping/thinking he had changed. He never will. Men like that don't. I was his unwitting fool for nearly 5 years, now she has that burden. I haven't heard from him since or heard anything from his family who still occasionally keep in touch as to whether she dumped him or not...my gut instinct is she didn't. Either way, my conscience is clear, a \"favor\" has been returned, and I'm still happily no longer with a cheater. Cheers folks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Contacted the gf, told her everything, she said thanks, we went our separate ways. No Jerry Springer.",

      "body": "OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dkl4r/overheard_roommates_2024m_talking_about_how/\n\nFirstly, I just wanted to thank you guys for being so sweet in the last thread. I was so stressed out and you guys made me laugh. : )\n\nFirst update was removed because I forgot a link, but I fixed it. Onto the update.\n\nBefore I posted, I was basically set on hiding awkwardly in my room or maybe dressing more conservatively when I left my room. After I saw all your responses, I was filled with a feminist, body-positive rage. These boys were not going to get away with slut shaming me. \n\nOf the three guys, I'm closest with Tom (Boy 1/3), so I decided to talk to him individually. I heard him coming up the stairs and I just took a deep breath and walked out of my room, smiled, and asked if I could talk to him for a minute. \n\nHe came into my room and we were just making small talk. I shut the door, summoned all of my assertiveness, and said, \"So, I actually have something weird to talk to you about. I heard you guys talking about me the other day.\"\n\nI'd like to say that I threw down with this boy, that I told him that sexism is not cool or funny and I won't put up with it and demand that he apologize. But instead I, um. \n\nI cried. \n\nA lot. \n\nI straight up just broke down, I couldn't even speak. Tom look absolutely devastated. He immediately apologized, said I wasn't supposed to hear any of that, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was just trying to get a grip on myself. There's nothing more awkward than crying in front of someone when you're \"not on that level\" yet. \n\nAnyway, I asked him if that was really what he thought of me. He said no, and that they were just being dumb, and that when Sam (Boy 2/3) brought it up he was really surprised and knew it was wrong but he didn't call him out on it. He said he should have, and he knew he should have, but he didn't want to make a big deal about it because Sam and Bob (Boy 3/3) were just joking around, even though they were being mean. He said it was shitty of him not to call them out and that by not saying anything and acting like it was funny, he allowed it to happen. He said that he has no excuse and he's sorry.\n\nThis checks out- from what I heard, it was mainly Sam and Bob saying the bad stuff. I said I knew they were just joking around but it made me feel horrible to be talked about that way, and that the sexism really slapped me in the face. \n\nHe agreed and said it was horrible, and he also said something like \"not that it's an excuse, but you're really pretty and I think thats why we were talking about you that way. none of us actually believed what we were saying but i think it was just wishful thinking and we were idiots about it.\" \n\nSo for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO. \n\nI laughed and told Tom that I had a girlfriend. He said that was totally cool, and then looked embarrassed and said they must have looked like complete idiots bragging about how much I wanted to sleep with them. I agreed. \n\nTom asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it. I told him not to tell the other guys anything because I don't really want to talk about it anymore, but if they ever start talking about another person like that, even if it's not me, to speak up. He promised me he would and apologized about 9000000 more times and left. \n\nI heard him go into his room, and then immediately leave and go out the front door. I didn't think much of it and put my headphones in and played Trackmania for a while.\n\nLater that day I opened my door and there was a big cardboard box right outside my door. My first thought was that I'd ordered something from amazon and forgot about it, but it looked like a used box that someone had repurposed and taped shut. I dragged it into my room and opened it. \n\nGuys. It was a bouquet of flowers and a cake with the word \"SORRY\" written on it. \n\nIf you're thinking that I cried for the second time in three hours, well . . . you're right. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry I didn't throw down with them like so many of you wanted. Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. I'm working a lot on being more assertive but in this scenario I handled it as best as I could. Confronting Tom about it was actually super scary, but I'm proud of myself for bringing it up at all. \n\nI accept Tom's apology. He seemed genuine, and this does seem like a one-off shitty behavior situation. He's usually a pretty stand-up guy. The other guys . . . I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't super sold on them to start with, so I feel like I'll just continue to not pursue a friendship with them. And I'll continue to dress however I want. : )\n\nLastly, serious thanks to all of you for your responses. I was hesitant to post this on reddit because reddit can sometimes be . . . not so nice about women's issues. But yall are cool. <3 \n   \n**tl;dr**: Talked to one of the boys about it, cried a lot, got cake.",

      "body": "Original Post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sf4ql/girlfriend_21_f_is_furious_at_me_21_m_after_my/\n\n(tl:dr- grandmother said racist and derogatory things about my girlfriend in spanish right in front of her not knowing she could understand some spanish.) \n\nPeople gave me a really hard time in my original post and it really made me realize how much of a dumbass I was being. I apologized profusely to Olivia and called out my extremely stupid behavior and basically begged for forgiveness. After a couple more days of being mad at me she was willing to talk to my parents and my brother who apologized and told her that they really loved her and that they didn’t mean to hurt her. They tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and why she behaved the way she did and they were just trying to minimize drama but that what she was saying was wrong and they should have stood up to her. My mother got her a gift set from bath and body works, costume jewelry and chocolate to go along with the apology. \n\nSo Olivia did forgive me and my family which I am so relieved about because I really am crazy about this girl. I’m definitely not going to take this for granted. A week ago my brother, Olivia and I went to an amusement park and my brother and her actually got along really well and she’s definitely convinced he doesn’t secretly hate black people. (I never thought my brother was racist - when he was in middle school he “dated” a black girl.) He's only 15 so I definitely don't blame him for what happened. It was my dad's fault for laughing. But yeah he really likes her and is glad she doesn't hate him. My mom invited Olivia to a beach with our family on Saturday (My abuela stayed at home) and although she mostly stayed by me and my brother she seemed to get along reasonably with my parents and seems to believe their apology (she was a bit hesitant to go). \n\nI have told my grandmother that if she wants me to be actively part of her life she must apologize to Olivia. My grandmother actually agreed to apologize but my gf doesn’t want to talk to her and I told her I will not force her to be around her but I did tell her that my grandmother is sorry for the way she behaved. \n\nSo yeah that's my update. I appreciate all the replies no matter how harsh. It really made my realize my stupidity. Still have a lot of growing up to do but I am really happy she took me back. \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Olivia forgave me after my parents and I apologized and we are still together. She still  understandably doesn't want to talk to my grandmother though.",

      "body": "I've lived in this apartment complex since I moved out of my parents house when I was 18. I love this building, love my home, and I've never had a problem with any of the other tenants. \n\nA new family just moved into the apartment next to mine. At first, everything was fine. Their son was a little noisier than I'd like, but it's just something to get used to.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, the Mom approached me and took me to the side. She told me that she liked the apartment, everything was fine, except for one thing: her son's room was next to mine, and he could very obviously hear me having sex with my boyfriend.\n\nI apologized and said I'd try to keep things a little quieter. She told me that she thinks it's for the best if I move my bedroom, or have sex somewhere else, just in case her son hears. I told her that wasn't going to happen, but I would definitely try to be more courteous about timing.\n\nFast forward to this past week. My boyfriend (who lives with me part-time, but is a grad student on the go most of the time, so we don't always see each other) was over, and we ended up having sex. It was probably 4 in the afternoon. While we're going at it, there's a knock on the door. I'm not expecting anyone, so we ignore it, and the knocking continues.\n\nThen comes the shouting. I need to stop, I'm being disgusting, don't I know there's a child in the next apartment, I'm a degenerate, I'm a slut, I'm a hooker, etc etc etc. She went away eventually, but not after yelling some more.\n\nNow, I don't know. Am I being unreasonable about this? I don't think it's fair for me to have to adhere to someone else's schedule just because their son shares a wall with me. We aren't screaming banshees and slapping the headboard against the wall, but we're two adults doing what we love doing. \n\nThe woman caught me leaving for work this morning and told me that if I didn't stop \"exposing myself\" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing. \n\nWhat am I to do here?\n\n**TL/DR:** Woman thinks I am the devil because her son shares a wall with me, and he can hear me and my boyfriend having sex. I'm not about to stop having sex in my apartment, but I would like this to stop.",

I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resumé I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others.\n\nI (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies & passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying \"garlic bread\".\n\nNow, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resumé.\n\nI came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resumé (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to \"garlic bread\" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total.\n\nIt was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resumé, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification.\n\nMy sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words \"I'm sorry\" definitely left her mouth.\n\nThen she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like \"just a prank brah\" mentality but I'm having none of it.\n\nI don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the \"garlic bread\" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob?\n\nTechnically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resumé-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resumé fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resumé? Should I just fucking move town at this point since I've clearly made a fool of myself already? Also, how do I talk to my parents or sister about her stupid spoilt bratty behavior?\n\n\n   \nTL;DR: My little sister changed my hobbies and passions section on my resumé to \"garlic bread\" as a joke and I sent it out to about 20/30 business in my town unknowingly. I have no idea how to fix this.",

I thought I should share what happened after the post to u guys since I got so many helping replies.\n\nSo first of all one thing I realised was that I never thought that he might not like what I like in bed. I believed he was also enjoying as much and never properly talked to him about it.\n\nAnd then me and my husband had a long conversation about the issue. At first he was like there is no issues at all. So I asked him what part of our intimacy did he like the most. He told me he liked undressing me and seeing me naked the most and then after sex cuddling as second. So basically the specific PiV part was not liked. I asked him if he has any specific thing he wanted to introduce. He didn't have anything perticular in mind so I asked him to look it up with me. We read some online stuff about different kinks. He showed interest towards blindfolds and handcuffs. So we bought it.\n\nThe next night we decided to try it out. He handcuffed and blindfolded me. Halfway through, he suddenly opens my blindfolds and tells me that it was even worse than before. So I thought it was a failure.\n\nYesterday night, I was thinking about some other stuff we can do when he came to me with the handcuffs. But this time... He wanted me to use it on him instead. At first I was like wtf?? But I decided why not it won't hurt to try. So I handcuffed him, took the lead. And for me... I enjoyed the fuck out of it. His reactions were amazing to watch. I did fumble a few times but we reached the end. He also told me this was hugely better. So.... Yeah looks like he was a submissive type. I myself am not a pure dom but I liked to take to lead too. \n\nAnd I also asked him that he told me at first that he liked seeing me naked so how is he also liking being blindfolded? He said that he did like to see me but the fact that he wasn't able to turned him on. Can anyone explain this to me? \n\nOtherwise reading ur replies was a big big help. So thank u to all of u. I would also be happy to say he is not asexual or has someone else. \n\nTldr: husband turned out of be a sub.",

      "body": "This is a really strange situation. I hung out with a guy I sort of know at a bar for a while, and he asked to see my gaming PC so we went over my apartment. Jokingly, his friends were saying we were going up there to fuck (I live above the bar). We did a tiny bit of coke while we were up there, hung out and played games and talked about the PC for like maybe an hour and a half or so, then he went back down and I stayed up there. \n\nWhile he was down there, I dont know what got into him, but he must have told his friends some story that ended with us having sex. Or its possible one of his friends just thought that? I have no idea, he was really coked up when he left downstairs so I assume it was him who told the story. \n\nthe next day I awoke to a whole lot of people messaging me saying that they heard me and george (the guy) had sex and that they had no idea I was gay and they wanted to congratulate me and all that. I am not sure HOW this spread so fast, but 4 people hit me up. Apparently the rumor developed into not only did I have sex with him, but I also came out to him as gay? \n\nEither way, I wrote a FB status right there and then seeking to end this tirade, saying it didnt happen, me and george didnt do anything, its just some weird lie or rumor. A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. Another girl wrote as her status \"when straight guys call a gay man a liar about them having sex just to protect his masculinity\" and it was kind of obvious she was referring to me. \n\nI dont even know what to say. For one, I hit up george, I called him, its been 4 days, zero response. I am not even sure if I have the right phone number. I am not even sure if its HIM spreading this rumor at all, it could have just been someone who saw him go up to my apartment. I've gotten a few more messages from people congratulating me for coming out, and that \"they had no idea!\" and stuff like that. I've told every single one, sorry, its just a rumor, some of them were like 'oh okay sorry'  and some didnt even respond, presumably because they saw my status and that guy who commented on it. \n\nI don't know what to do. I dont give a shit if I was gay, but I don't want to be known as gay when I am not. Its just a weird feeling because people have accused me now of homophobia over this and I just feel terrible because I have no bad feelings towards gay people, but I just want people to know, I am not gay. Like, this isn't true, at all. But now everytime I deny it it just looks worse. One of my friends hit me up and she said \"look, I know you are denying it, but on the chance you are gay and just feel embarrassed thats okay too!\" and it just made me realize I may never be able to shake this off\n\nWhat the hell do I do? I barely even know this george guy, he might never respond! \n\nEdit: In the title I said 'refuses to tell the truth', really its more like he isnt responding at all \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Being accused of sleeping with a dude, I am not gay. Its spreading all over facebook.",

      "body": "**EDIT #1: Oh man, this blew up more than I expected. Thanks for all the insight so far. I got a lot of responses that made me realize I did not paint a clear picture on some vital points, which I will do here and continue to add.**\n\n**a. Him saying \"I have a job\" involves a specific tone and inflection which is where the rudeness comes from.**\n\n**b. This is not his first job, nor his first job working these hours by any means. Nothing about this job is new beyond a different industry/company and the payraise.**\n\n**c. He goes out almost every night. To the bar. With or without friends. I am typically invited. I see him about once a week because of me needing time alone to do work / study, not him. I do not live with him.**\n\n**d. Him saying \"I have a job\" in this manner to our friends - not just me - is what made me see this as less of a \"he doesn't respect my job/work\" and more like a \"he doesn't realize how he comes off\" situation.**   \n\n**e. Yes, he is a functioning alcoholic. That is another conversation**.\n\nI'll try to add more as I realize what I've missed and respond to people. Thanks again.\n\n\n\nRelationship: off/on for about 2 years.\n\nI’ve been working from home for a while (freelance) so that I can take classes I need as prereqs for a graduate program. It’s been taking like... years (3?) but I’ve also been working. I finally took on freelancing/working from home so i could take certain classes that typically conflicted w normal work hours. It’s great. It also has created a less predictable sleep/work day. \n\nRecently my bf also got a new job which pays better and also requires more hours out of him. He used to wake at like... 10am-11 and leave work around 5 with a flexible schedule. Now he gets up at 6/7 to get to work at 8am.\n\nThis is a bit of background to explain my interpretation of bf’s behavior. \n\nMy bf started saying “I have a job” as a response to things, questions, comments. Things like “You should stay over at my place” or “Are you going to bed?” or especially “Are you going to the bar tonight?” even, which he does every single night and drinks with whoever there. I used to think this kind of response was just directed at me due to my working from home and working to start a new career. And yes, I find it insulting.\n\nJust last night we were at a friend’s house gathering, sitting around the fire drinking, and he kept saying he wanted to leave (yet filled a cup full of wine for the Uber ride home), so we started to get up to go. A friend made a comment like “awww you’re leaving! I wish you’d stay!” Or something similar. \n\nHis immediate response: “I have a job!” ... almost like an incredulous response. \n\nThis friend had a brief moment of confusion and said, smiling, said I have a job too!”. My bf just kept going, saying “I have to be there at 8!” And she again responded “I have to be at my job at 8am too!” and having this look on her face like... thinking this was funny in a way? Like she’s in grad school and working and hearing him say this to her. Like, man you’re talking to a bunch of 30 year olds not some fresh college grads. \n\nI tried to tell him that it doesn’t make sense for him to keep saying that to people... like who here doesn’t have a job? That it sounds condescending and it doesn’t make sense.\n\nHe just gets offended and pissed and shuts down. I don’t know how else to explain it to him. Help?\n\n**tl;dr bf keeps saying “i have a job” as a response to  people’s comments which is weird and condescending, and he gets offended when I try to tell him this. Don’t know how to proceed**",

      "title": "Today I saw the man that saved me when I was being raped",
      "body": "When I was 13 years old I was raped behind a church next to the middle school I attended. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a sunny day in the spring, right before school was out for the summer. I had a couple friends I hung out with and they persuaded me to skip class with them. As we were leaving the campus, security yelled at us to stop and everyone started running in different directions. I ended up behind the church, alone. As I was catching my breath a man came around the corner. He was much much bigger than I was at 13 years old. I was immediately scared and knew something bad was going to happen. He came up to me and said I was “the snack” he had been looking for. I tired to run, but he grabbed me and pinned me against the wall. I had no chance of escaping him. He was such a big guy. \n\nI’ll spare you all the details. The assault happened for around 3 minutes. I was exhausted from trying to fight off this man and trying to scream while he was crushing my body with his. I don’t remember if I passed out, or if my brain has been trying to block out the trauma, but all I remember happening next is another man jumping on my attacker and just beating the shit out of him. I didn’t see him coming.\n\nI was naked, crying, dirty, I didn’t know what to do. The man who saved me ended up knocking out my attacker. He gave me a blanket and comforted me as best he could until police arrived. The next couple years of my life were just a blur of depression. The man was arrested, my family moved us away from the area and we never told anyone besides my immediate family. \n\nIt has been 8 years since this happened. Today I went to McDonald’s near the neighborhood I grew up in and saw the man who saved me that day. I went through the drive-thru and he handed me my food. As soon as I looked into his eyes I recognized him but couldn’t tell where I knew him from. He smiled at me and said “you don’t remember me huh” I laughed awkwardly and said “remind me”.  All he said was the name of that church and every single memory that I had been trying so hard to forget came flooding back. I looked at him again and started sobbing. It was such an insane situation. I was sobbing in the McDonald’s drive-thru. I was partly crying because of all the memories, but mostly because this man SAVED me and I didn’t even remember him.. \n\nHe came out, we sat 6 feet apart, and we talked for almost an hour. Just about life. He told me that his fiancé is pregnant with their first baby and they’re expecting a baby girl. He’s doing well.\n\nI feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I’ve thought about him through the years and have always wondered where he was, how he was. Today I finally got my peace.\n\nEdit: I am overwhelmed with all the positive messages and comments I am getting. I didn’t anticipate this response. \n\nTo people leaving supportive comments: thank you all so much, you all are angels. \n\nTo the people leaving nasty comments: please, please stop.",

      "body": "I never wanted kids, but was never adamantly against having one. I get married. My wife knows how I feel about kids. When we were engaged - my answer was \"maybe one, definitely not more.\"\n\nAs my friends started having kids, I started leaning heavily against having kids. Some parents had good kids. Some parents had bad kids. Even the easy kids looked like too much work.\n\nQueue my wife's sister dying. All of a sudden \"family\" is SUPER important to my wife. I get that. \n\nAt this point my answer to kids was still no. My wife bothered me and bothered and bothered me. Eventually I was convinced. The deal was her parents would sell their ranch and come live on our street. \n\nI was convinced. I was so dumb. I was told not to worry about all the realities of having a kid and losing my life - because grandma and grandpa are down the street and would be all the parents baby ever needed. Since my wife's sister died - she was the only hope for grandkids.\n\nMy wife and her parents worked me over so good. They convinced me. They made good points. My wife's parents were in their 50's and good health - they would be here \"beyond the baby phase\" and \"would have enough energy to keep up with a kid\".\n\nI'm shown enough Disney movies and Kodak moment and am promised that I just have to be a good dad and provider. A 1950's dad if you will - one where the mom unfairly does all the hard stuff. All the good and no bad? Cool - fine by me.\n\nWell here we are, 11 years later. My kid has \"ODD\" which is pretty much alphabet soup for your kid being an asshole and defiant. Nothing else is wrong with them - the diagnosis is literally that they are vindictive and cruel and seek conflict. Not because they can't communicate or are hypsersensitive to stimuli - but just because.\n\nGuess what? Grandma and grandpa say the kid is \"too much\". They haven't helped for more than a day a month in almost 7 years.\n\nAnd here I am - on reddit on my laptop, tethered to my phone in a parking lot at the park after dark. I came home from work to my son spitting on the neighbors to door knob - his reason \"get the neighbors sick\". Why does he want them sick? His amazon package got delivered to their house in the morning and they waited until evening to give it to him.\n\nWell in returning to for telling him not to do that, my son went into the attic and peed all over the one bankers box of memorabilia I have from my parents - who both died before I was 20.\n\nI left the house and am sitting in my car. I don't know if I'm coming back.\n\nAnd I don't want advice. This isn't \"lack of discipline\" or \"bad parenting\". I've read every book. I've worked shifts 6 days a week for a decade to pay for tens of thousands (probably 100,000's) of therapy, behaviorists, counseling, classes. You name it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is my fault. I am so spineless. I knew I didn't want kids. I was convinced, because, well, I'm a jellyfish. And here I am. 45 years old, crying in my car in the park.\n\nMy advice to other men and women out there: only have a kid if you 1000% want them. Don't listen to others when they say they'll \"help\". They'll help if you have a happy, bubbly easy-going kid. Not if you spawned the devil himself.",

      "body": "I (Male 22) fell in love with my gym bro (Male 24). Problem being, I thought I was straight.\n\nThis all started a few months ago, I noticed this guy at my gym and I knew something was immediately off. I was like nervous to even look at him, but I decided to get rid of that nervousness and just talk to him. He was actually really nice and funny and we quickly became buddies. Then about two weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me. I told him that and we had a heart to heart where he casually came out as gay. But that initial offness that I felt when I first saw him didn’t go away, and I quickly started to piece together that it was the same feeling I get when I look at a really pretty girl. \n\nAnd over the months it’s been increasingly hard to be near him because he’s just so…gorgeous I guess. Whenever I go to sleep, I just imagine him there snuggled up to me. I just wanna text him all the time…and I just wanna kiss him so bad. I guess this is me coming out as bi…I met a beautiful guy at the gym and we became best friends, I love his personality, he makes me laugh nonstop, and ngl he’s mad thick. I wanna ask him out so bad\n\n**Update**: at the gym rn, we’re gonna do our sets and when we leave ima walk him to his car and tell him. Thanks for the courage everyone!\n\n**update 2**: I’m fucking crying in my car rn holy shit. He said yes. So I walked him to his car and I told him. And bruh…the way I couldn’t speak lmao I was so nervous. But basically, he said he kinda thought I was into him cause “I can only catch you respectfully staring at my butt so many times before it’s a little sus”. But I told him that I’m bi…and we’re going on a date Friday. But like bruh…he looked so flustered and cute when I told him…he had the prettiest smile lmao. And for the people saying stuff about my vocab and texting…I’m a history major, not smart…my vocab consists of “I guess”, “like”, “idk”, “bruh”, and “fucking”. But anyways…I guess we’re a little more than just gym bros now…I seriously couldn’t have done this if this didn’t get so much random ass support lmao. Anyways…I’m fucking shaking…I actually did it…bruh I love him so much…so so so fucking much. Thank you for the support!\n\n**Update 3**: https://twitter.com/lilstupidwhore/status/1521696754567163904?s=21&t=qP69rlQ9PaNI4GPZbmM7IA\n\n**Update 4**: Hey there, I know I’ve been gone for a long ass time lmao. But I had to take a social media break just because like…I was just really overwhelmed I guess with all the attention this post got. Some of you were asking about update 3, it was just me talking on Twitter about the insecure assholes calling me a woman for sharing emotions lmao. I deleted it cause I felt a bit embarrassed having my voice on the internet lmao…I’m too introverted for that shit. But I will be making occasional updates on my Twitter I guess. As for how me and my man are doing…it’s better than I could’ve asked for…I know we haven’t been together super long I guess…but…he just like…idk…I’ve just never felt more appreciated by someone…so yeah, he’s got me wrapped around his finger hella hard lmao. But I think I’m just gonna ultimately log out of this Reddit account but still keep the post up for you guys…just know my Twitter is where I’ll be making updates occasionally.",

Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate, who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them. They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority, including coercion, to achieve it.[1]\n\n\nDirectly from wikipedia folks. Peace out bitches.",

      "body": "Well… I did it I told her. And yeah it was pretty heavy. My heart was even beating fast.  i kept trying to think how to tell her. Many of the comments on my last post here mentioned writing her a letter just how she wrote a letter for me. Originally that was the plan but for me it felt like I needed to say it. \n\nOh,  really quick I wanna say thanks to everyone for their love and support. Mostly to all the birth parents out there who shared their stories with me. That’s what really helped push me to have the courage to confront her. It meant so much so thanks.\n\n\nEverything happened day before yesterday btw.\n\n I did wait for her to be done with her shift and that was when they were closing the restaurant already. And waited in the parking lot. We said hi when she saw me first but then I told her there was something serious that she needed to know. First told her sorry for keeping it from her this long. She didn’t react until I actually pulled out her letter. \n\nAnd she started bawling from there. Like screaming and crying at the same time, and didn’t even have to finish the whole “I’m your son” speech. She just saw it and knew. It was crazy. Next thing I know she’s hugging me instantly but then she pulled back and asked if it’s okay to hug me. Ofc it is and we’re just there hugging an crying in the parking lot. It hit her hard though. Her legs gave out for a second so I had to actually hold her up while she’s still hugging me for a min. \n\nWhat really got me was her saying to me look how big you got. also hearing her cry made me cry too. She went back to open the restaurant up (she wouldn’t take no for an answer) we had coffee, ate a slice of their pie inside and talked. Soooo many stuff we talked about. She told me the second time I came to the restaurant she got a feeling but for her it was hard believe it was me. So that feeling she had was pushed way down. \n\nBecause she told me for years after I was adopted she saw kids that would be my age and used to think they were me. Then she would be crying in public. It fucked with her mind a lot and made her depressed so she didn’t want to do the same when she saw me, getting her hopes up like that. \n\nShe says I look so much like my biological dad when he was younger though. We talked about him too. They stayed in contact with eachother incase I ever reached out to one of them so it would be easier to contact the other. I didn’t have hope about finding my biological dad since he was never mentioned so I’m glad they both planned for this future scenario. She told me about how they wanted to keep me. Especially my biological dad, he didn’t want me to be adopted. But he knew they had to because they were just kids. It took him a long time to get passed it after I was born she told me. That’s why he didn’t leave anything because he didn’t wanna believe he might not see me again. \n\nWe talked for hours. Til almost 2 in the morning (they closed at 11). She just wanted to know everything about me but her main thing was “am I happy”. Were my parents good to me. Did I have a happy childhood. And I did. I told her thank you for helping to give me this life. We both cried again. She cried the most. Everything was very emotional for her. Sometimes she would look really happy but then get sad again.\n\nAfter my 18th birthday she was hoping I would find her that’s why she stayed in the same city. But since I didn’t she always thought maybe I resented her, wasn’t told I’m adopted, or maybe had decided it was better not to have her around. It made me feel bad for not telling her sooner. She told me it’s not my fault and I did right going at my own pace. Honestly she’s so sweet. The way she kept looking at me with the biggest smile,  it made me emotional sometimes. Makes you think how can someone who’s been a total stranger ur whole life look at you with so much love. It’s wild. We learned so much about eachother. She asked me if we could have dinner soon to keep talking. And if at some point in the future if I’m interested come over to her house so I can meet her husband. That all sounded really great. \n\nWe exchanged numbers. After I left she sent a text telling me thank you for giving her this gift that she didn’t know if it would ever come. \n\nMy girlfriend came over and she hugged me while I cried. I wasn’t sad btw these were happy tears. Everything went better than I expected. There was still emotionally heavy stuff but I’m still glad that we got to open up to eachother.",

      "body": "I need a little advise on the matter as I don't know what to do anymore. \n\n\nI was 21 when my fiance asked me to marry him. \n\nHe was the absolute light of my life. We had known each other since pre school, our family's are very close. \n\nHe would come and have dinner with us on a daily basis and vice versa. He doesn't have any siblings but I have 2 older sisters. Which is very important as he was also very close with them. \n\nWe grew up together. When we started dating, I don't think our parents stopped celebrating for weeks. \n\nHe helped me deal with a lot of my anxiety and even when I gained a little weight and my mother berated me saying he was going to leave me, he told her off and said he loved me for who I was, not for what I looked like, even though he claimed I was the most beautiful girl in the world to him. \n\nWe were only engaged for 6 months before the inncident.\n\nMy middle oldest sister, lets call her Nicky, was a very cold person, she never showed any affection, she only ever opened up to my fiance as she said she saw him as a brother and he also helped her through a lot of her dark times such as battling drug addictions and breaking the law. \n\nShe and I never saw eye to eye, I loved her dearly because she was my sister but didn't like her as a person. \n\nOut of the blue she tells me she wants to take me clubbing as we had never been together before and she felt bad that she was so distant to me. \n\nI agreed and that night we went out. \n\nClubbing wasn't really my style but once I had a few drinks, I loosened up a little and began having fun. \n\nThe night was going smoothly until Nicky spotted a guy across the room whom she claimed she wanted to \"climb like a tree\" She walked over to him and within a few minutes she was back and she had a sour expression on her face. \n\nI asked her what was up but she never said anything. \n\nI kept pressing because I didnt want our night to be ruined, she then told me the guy didn't want her number but he wanted mine instead. \n\nI told her he was a loser and there were plenty of guys around who would kill to be with a girl like her, she didn't budge though. \n\nShe told me she needed to use the restroom and then we would leave. \n\nI waited for other an hour, during this time I was sipping on a lot of different cocktails, I then started feeling really dizzy and lightheaded. \n\nI figured I'd just cab it home as I was certain Nicky had left. \n\nOn the way out though, I bumped into a friend of Nicky's whom she had briefly dated. \n\nHe asked me If I needed a hand to my car and I explained I was getting a cab  he said he was getting ready to leave and we could share one. I told him okay and we walked out of the club together and into the first cab we saw. \n\nI tried to find my phone in my purse but I felt myself getting dizzier and dizzier. \n\nI don't remember what happened next as I blacked out and the next morning I woke up on a hard sofa, my head pounding. \n\nWhen I came to, I realised I was in Nicky's friends house and my phone was sitting on the glass table in front of me, but it was flat. \n\nWhen he noticed I was awake he offered some tablets and water and explained that I had passed out in the cab and he didnt remember my parents address so he just picked me up and took me back here where he laid me on the sofa. \n\nI told him I needed to go home as my fiance would be worried. \n\nHe called a cab and I left. When I arrived at my parents house, my mother, father, Nicky, my fiance and his parents were all standing in the living room. \n\nI thought they were worried about me but the instant I opened my mouth my fiance asked how could I do this to him? \n\nI tried to explain that my phone went flat but he then went on screaming about how could I cheat on him. \n\nI was baffled. Why would he think that? I tried to explain the nights events but I kept getting cut off. \n\nNicky then chimed in and said I was a lying S and how could I be so heartless to a man who has been there for me through thick n thin. \n\nShe went on to say I kept flirting with random guys all night and then when she went to the bathroom, she saw me leave with her friend. \n\nI told her what had happened and she showed me photos on her phone where as we were leaving, his hand was on my back ushering me outside, yes the photo did look horrible and I was so drunk I didn't even realise his hand was on my back at all. \n\nMy fiance was so angry, he kept shouting and his mum and mine were both crying. \n\nI then asked Nicky to call her friend and he would confirm Nothing happened but when she called him, he told a completely different story. \n\nHe said I begged him to take me back to his and when he did, we slept together multiple times. \n\nI saw red and started crying and yelling at Nicky because I knew she had organised this whole thing to make me look bad.\n\nI begged my fiance to believe me, but he just shook his head and left. When everyone had cleared out, my mother slapped me across the face and told me to get out. \n\nI left and went to a friends house where I stayed for a few nights. During those nights I called my fiance crying and pleading with him to believe me that nothing happened but it all fell on deaf ears as he never returned any of my calls or texts. \n\nMy mum texted me and told me she was kicking me out and that she couldnt believe I would do such a thing and a lot of hurtful other slurs I don't think I could repeat here. \n\nShe didn't even give me time to get my things as she threw everything out. \n\nI was now homeless. None of my family would take me in, as they chose my fiance and mothers side. \n\nI was homeless and single in less than a day and a half, my entire world had been taken away because of Nicky's lies. \n\nNow for weeks I tried everything to get my fiance back and my family.\n\nThe limit for me though was when Christmas time had come and I went over to my mothers house to try and reconcile. I was sleeping from couch to couch during this time. \n\nWhen I got to my parents house, I knocked on the door but no one answered. My friend then called me and told me she just saw on facebook that my family were in another state celebrating Christmas and they had posted pictures online. \n\nEveryone was there, my sisters, parents, grandparents and even my fiance and his family. \n\nWhen I myself saw the photos, I couldn't stop crying as they all looked so happy. \n\nI cried for days and days before deciding to block them all. I even returned my engagement ring. \n\nMy friend knew someone a couple hours away who was looking for some help in his restaurant and he even had living arrangments above where he worked so I could get rent at a cheap price and work at the same time. \n\nI wanted to start over with my life as it hurt me that noone took my side and they all left me to fend for myself. \n\nI was able to move pretty quickly and was doing well, the apartment was tiny and I had to work 10+ hours almost every day, but I was able to save a lot of money. \n\nIm not living in the apartment anymore, I was able to rent a much nicer condo but I am still working at the restaurant as assistant manager. \n\nNow it has been roughly two years since I left and have not spoken to any of my family. I have no idea what is going with them until I got a knock on my door. \n\nIt was my ex fiance. I was shocked to say the least, all these feelings came rushing back and all I wanted to do was jump into his arms. \n\nBut then I remembered the pain I had felt and tried to slam the door in his face but he stopped it and asked that I let him explain. \n\nHe said that Nicky had gotten married and she had confessed that she lied about the situation because she had found someone she loved so much and realised what a horrible thing she had done. \n\nI asked him how he found me and he said my friend told him. \n\nMy entire family had been trying to get in touch with me and want to see me. \n\nI told him I needed time to see if I even wanted To have them in my life. \n\nHe left and I have been a mess since. \n\nI don't know what to do, I know I will never ever forgive Nicky, she could rot for all I cared but Its hard because my other family and fiance didn't know she was lying, but I also felt like they abandoned me too quickly without letting me explain my side. \n\nI don't know if I should forgive them. \n\nAny advice would be much helpful. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

I didn’t have any post high school education and was working as a construction worker. Before my wife passed away, we both worked full time and were able to rent a small but nice house. But as a single working parent, I could hardly make ends meet and had to move in to a tiny apartment. That Christmas, when I didn’t have enough money left over to get my kids the gifts they deserved, I really knew I had to do something. I started taking college classes at night while working 2 jobs, and after five long years, I graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering and got a job making 6 figures. I bought a nice house with a huge yard for my kids to play in, built them a treehouse, and have enough time off to spend plenty of time with them. Last week, I took them on a camping trip in the mountains. It’s not until now that I really let myself believe that I actually did it.\n\nEdit: thank you so much to everybody! I’m very overwhelmed by all the replies. I will try to answer as many as possible.",

I want all people in this country to have equal opportunities, access to shelter, access to food, access to good education, help for their mental health, help for their addictions, free healthcare, just overall an equal opportunity for success and happiness, as close to that as we can get. I want police and justice reform. I want environmental reform. I want a healthy happy country and planet for children to hrow up in.\n\nBut whenever I express this to people, I get scoffed at. I'm just a dumb, lazy millenial that wants free handouts. I should move to another country if the current system bothers me. Minimum wage is too high. Healthcare and college are perfectly affordable, you just don't work hard enough. The justice system is fine, and the cops are all saints; hell, give them more money! Mental health? Eh, you'll be fine. \n\nThis may sound like I'm talking about Trump supports, but this 100% applies to many other parts of the American political system.

I am honestly so grateful for all the support, advice, beautiful messages and awards you guys have gifted.\n\n I wish I could personally thank each and everyone of you, and I did try my best to reply to every message. \n\nYou guys are honestly so amazing and I cried reading all the comments, my heart has never been so touched with the ammount of love and support I got on this post and I am so sorry if it took too long to post an update. \n\nI was honestly in so much shock I didn't know how to cope with it. \n\n\nSo uh I never got back to my ex, I didn't know what to do, but eventually he must have given my phone number to my parents as they texted asking to meet up. I never replied and was planning on organising a zoom meeting but didn't need to as they also showed up at my door. Well my father did.\n\nWhen I answered the door and saw him standing there, I ended up throwing up which he insisted on cleaning. \n\nWhen he was done, we sat down and I just bursted in tears. \n\nMy emotions were all over the place and my father has worn the same cologne for a really long time, so when I smelt it, it just bought back all these memories. \n\nHe tried to hug me but I pushed him away and asked what he was doing here. \n\nHe went on to explain he and my mother are getting a divorce. He said he begged my mother to get in touch with me the minute I left, but she refused and said I was acting like a baby and if I wanted to leave them after doing something so horrible, then I could do things on my own from then on. \n\nI askes him how long did it take them to notice I was gone. \n\nHe said they arrived back home after News Years Eve and were planning on inviting me over so we could talk, that's when they got in touch with my friend and she told them I left and she didn't know where I was. \n\nI asked him why didn't he listen to my side of the story and why did they throw me away so easily. \n\nHe just started crying. He said he never meant for things to get so out of hand and he wishes more than anything he could take it all back. \n\nI said when they found out Nicky was taking drugs and had dropped out of HS, they didn't throw her away, instead we all went on a holiday so she could focus on things besides drugs and during that trip, she got hooked on alcohol and each time they defended her over and over. \n\nHe said he had no idea my mother was going to kick me out, he thought it was going to be for a few days but then they decided last minute to spend Christmas out of state. \n\nMy mother apparently promised him I would be allowed back home after they got back. \n\nI said she threw away all my stuff but he said everything was still there and she lied about that.  \n\nI asked him what has happened to Nicky and he said she is dead to him, he wants nothing to do with her but my mother has been crying to him, asking to forgive Nicky as she is not well and they had already lost one daughter, they cannot lose two. \n\nHe blocked my mother and Nicky and has been on my ex's case about finding me. My ex caved in when my dad said he blocked my mother and Nicky and told him where I lived. \n\nI asked that he never show up again unless I give him permission and he agreed. \n\nHe asked what would happen now and I said I really don't know and that he hurt me really bad. \n\nI then just went into detail about how much he hurt me and what it felt like seeing them so happy without me and how hard it is has been. \n\nWe were both crying by the end of it but I was really glad I got it all out, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nMy dad then said he knew a few places around the area and would help get me a better apartment and he said he would help get a better job but I told him I wouldn't be leaving this job as my boss helped me out so much and I wanted to repay him at all costs. \n\nI said I didn't want him to do anything for me, but I said I do want to reconcile but it has to be on my own terms and It is going to take a very very long time to trust him again, and I may never trust him again. \n\nHe said he would do anything to make up for what he did. \n\nI asked him why Nicky did this and if she said anything about it. Well she said she thought my ex deserved better than me and she wanted to see him happy because he was making too many sacrifices in the relationship, she loved him like a brother and wanted to break the engagement off, so that night she asked her friend to come and escort me out of the club so she could get photos and to take me home so her plan could work, she said nothing sexual happened, I went to sleep on the sofa and that was it, he was up playing video games all night until I woke up, which he has prove of apparently. \n\n\nMy dad was planning on getting my stuff from my mothers house and bringing it to me but I told him I didn't want those things anymore. \n\nI then went to ask about Nicky's husband and he said my mother has been hush hush with the entire situation but he had his number and wrote it down for me. \n\nAfter my dad left, I decided to call Nicky's husband.\n\nI was sweating the entire time and felt so sick, what if I could hear her in the background? \n\nWell anyhow when he picked up, I just spit everything out, which I deeply regret because I should have eased into it for him, he sounded really confused and I explained the entire situation again. I even went into detail about her drug and alcohol problems. \n\nI was honestly expecting him to curse me out and defend Nicky, instead he let out a long sigh and well turns out, he had a feeling she wasn't exactly innocent, turns out her and his sister have been having problems and she has been spouting non stop lies about his sister and has caused a huge rift between them, his sister didn't even attend their wedding. \n\nI told him I was sorry but he should make things right with his sister because Nicky was the problem not her. \n\nWe spoke a little more and he hung up. I'm not entirly sure what he is going to do with that information, I hope he cuts his loses and leaves her because he sounded like a really nice person and even he has lost his own sister because of Nicky. \n\nSo I have decided to reconcile with my dad, My mother has always run the show their entire marriage, so the fact he is putting his foot down and divorcing her and going nc with Nicky shows he is serious about wanting to make amends. \n\nI don't think I will ever reconcile with my mother, as she thinks Nicky is a victim also in all this and at this point I don't care to listen to her excuses. If she reaches out and we talk, I will update the post again. \n\nFor my ex, I haven't had the time to meet with him and talk, though my dad mentioned he wanted to come with my dad but he told him I would be too overwhelmed if both were there and seeing them separated will help make clear decisions. \n\nHe also mentioned my ex was arrested for assaulting Nicky's friend who lied about the entire situation, he was being charged but the charges were dropped a few days later. \n\nI will update the post again, when I have have time to speak to my ex. \n\nThank you guys for your being so patient and so caring and just amazing.",

She jumped off the dock and never came back up. By time they found her it had been close to 15 minutes.\n\nI made this post with the intent of reaching even just one person. I'd this made you think and reconsider how swimming is handled, then it did its job \n\nAnd I want to say Thank You!

      "body": "My husband and I are 28. We have 3 kids. He’s the only boyfriend I’ve ever had. He’s been with me since high school.\n\nHe’s always had low self esteem. I do too, but not like he does. \n\nOne day, we got new phones, maybe 7 years ago, I found out I can read his texts. He can see mine too, but he didn’t know about it. This happened for like another 2 years. For his birthday and Christmas I’d snoop around his texts and see if theres something he was talking about that he wanted.\n\nOne day, around November I was being nosey to see what I can get him for Christmas. I was pregnant with our second child at the time.\nI saw he was texting someone something suspicious, saying “where can we meet” and I thought this was with another girl. I read them more and I found out he was buying drugs.\n\nMy husband and I don’t even drink, so I freaked out. I wondered about how long this was going in for, if I even knew my own husband anymore. Turns out he was buying something that doesn’t get you high, but kills you.\n\nI looked around everywhere. I tore our room apart and didn’t find anything. I went through the search history and all his emails on his phone when he was asleep that night, and found o it he was making arrangements for a specific date 3 months after I was due. He was looking at life insurance, which we have had since I’m a stay at home mom. He was even looking up how much t costs to be cremated. Once he got home, the first thing I did was sneak his phone and text that guy and say “I’m no longer interested, if someone else tells you otherwise it means someone else has my phone” and deleted that guys number.\n\nI didn’t want him to know I was snooping but the thought of my husband not being around tore me. I remember being sick to my stomach and bawling in our room just thinking of the idea of not having him around. I love him more than life in itself. I would die for him and not even have to think about it. My husband is my entire world.\n\nThat day on I made sure he knew that, even if it meant embarrassing myself. I started bringing him flowers at work almost everyday. When he would come through the door I would screech with excitement and give him a hug and a smooch and tell him I missed him so much and I couldn’t stop thinking about him all day.\n\nWhen I was out with him how beautiful and handsome he is. When he was around my friends I’d say “look at my husband. He’s so beautiful” \nI’d call him at work and ask how much longer until he’s home. \n\nI got him to start going to therapy too.\n\nOne night I woke him up because I was freaking out and couldn’t sleep. I told him I had a nightmare. I said I had a dream he passed away. He said “why is that a bad thing?” And I told him how he’s my entire world and other than our son, and our other on the way, he’s all I live for.\nHe said “but things would be better if I was out of your hair.” And I said “no they wouldn’t. If you left me it would literally ruin my life.” \nHe said “not if you’re financially well off. You’ll be much better off” and I said “I could have all the money in the world. It would mean nothing if I didn’t have you. I’d much rather be homeless but still have you as my husband than be filthy rich and you be gone.” And he said “are you serious” and I said “100%. I’d sleep under a bridge if it meant I still got to sleep next to you”\n\n He said “I didn’t know you felt that way” and I said “I really do.” I asked if I could go with him to therapy. He said yes.\n\nI told his therapist I think he has depression, and he admitted he might. He got a prescription, and it seemed to help him a whole lot.\n\nEven though it’s been 5 years i still do all those nice things for him, like call him handsome and bring him flowers. I don’t ever want him to second guess for a second that he’s my sunshine.",

So that was that. Hubby went after him a few more times but eventually gave up. He became a rent-paying household member, catching the gnats that flew down into his dark little corner.  \n\nI began talking to him, saying *hi,* things like that. He never ran when it was just us. He trusted me. \n\nHe would even wave back a time or two. \n\nThis morning I went to take a shower to get at the dead skin attacking my feet, and a bottle of body wash fell over the side of the tub into his web. I don't know what he was doing down there, he'd been spending a lot of time close to the ground lately. But I hate myself. I hate that I took a shower this morning, I hate that I didn't just stay in bed with my itchy feet. I hate that I got attached to a stupid spider and now I'm crying so hard I can't breathe. \n\nMost people make a throwaway for embarrassing shit like this but I'm gonna own it.

      "title": "Every woman I get close to has some form of experience with sexual abuse, and it’s made me realise how much of a massive problem it truly is",
      "body": "So recently on a night out with some new friends I’ve made one of the girls I’ve got particularly close to was telling me about a guy that’s kind of a stalker to her that they all used to be friends with. She’d told me about the guy before, and a bunch of strange shit he’d done surrounding her and how he’d pester her, but this time she told me that the guy actually raped her at a house party a long time ago, and that having to still deal with his weird obsession to this day scares the shit out of her. I felt awful for her, the hesitant way she kind of went through it all made it obvious that reliving all this was really hard for her.\n\nBut the thing I’ve noticed is that every girl who I’m close enough with for them to trust me with a story like this, will have a story like this. Literally every girl who I’d consider a close friend has told me a similar story; my closest friend was spiked after meeting up with a guy she considers a friend, and he kept trying to make a move on her (he’d never tried this before and knew she was dating her ex at the time) and she highly suspects it was him who spiked her, even though she has no proof. Luckily one of her friends was there to get her home safe and get her away from him. \n\nThe one that stuck with me most came from a girl I got really close with last year. She always seemed kind of intimidating and unapproachable (she’s really one of the kindest and funniest people I’ve met deep down though), but she told me she kind of puts on a tough act to keep people at arms length cause she was raped when she was 14, that it sent her spiralling into waves of depression and anxiety because the dude involved told everyone at school that she fucked him and 3 other guys at the same time to ruin her reputation out of spite, that she had to get psychiatric help cause she was self harming, that she struggles to open up to anyone, and only in the last couple of years has she managed to work through it really. She told me all this with a nonchalant smile on her face, as if it was nothing to her, even though from her voice breaking up I could tell how much it still upset her, and that was sad as fuck to me. In fact, every girl who’s told me a similar story has had that same look, trying to act like it’s no big deal, saying there’s no need to apologise to them cause ‘it’s in the past now’, that they’re sorry for bringing it up cause there’s no use talking about it, etc.\n\nAnd it’s all just horrifically sad to me, that every girl seems to have some kind of story like this. They all seem broken over it even though they’re braving it out, they all seem resigned to the fact nothing will ever get done about what happened to them, and they all feel like a burden for even mentioning it. And it fucking sucks. I don’t even know what the point of this post is beyond acknowledging how widespread a problem this is; part of me always knew it logically, but as a guy I have that level of privilege where for a long time I was ignorant to the depths of the issue to a level where I could be detached from it emotionally, because it simply wasn’t an issue I had to worry about growing up. I feel stupidly blind that for the longest time I didn’t know quite how many people around me had been directly affected. The more I grow older and the more I encounter these stories firsthand, it really breaks me up inside. But what I have come away with from each of these encounters is a deep sense of utter respect and awe for each of these women, for how strong and brave they’ve had to be, and how much they deal with on their own. I will probably never really understand how it must feel to have to go through that, but I don’t need to understand it to be amazed by every woman who’s dealt with this shit, even when they probably feel their weakest and most vulnerable in opening up about it, all I’ve been able to think about each time is how strong they are.\n\nEDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who’s been brave enough to share their own experiences. I didn’t expect me just sharing my thoughts could promote such an open, supportive discussion between people who have actually experienced this, it’s really touching to see. My inbox is pretty packed right now and I need to get some sleep, but I plan on looking through all the replies to this over the next few days when I get the time and replying where I can, I feel like everyone that took the time and courage to share their stories in here deserves to have their voice heard and their experience listened to. Again, thank you for sharing, it’s been massively eye opening reading these.",

      "body": "I (32M) am a widow. My wife passed away from pancreatic cancer five years ago. She was forced to leave behind our two kids, R (10M) and H (7M). My wife was the absolute light of my life. We were high school sweethearts, went to the same college, and got married after graduation. We were inseparable. Every day I fell more in love with her; it was like my heart was living outside my body. When she passed, the amount of pain I was in was indescribable. I prayed to go to sleep and not wake up just so I could see her one last time. I contemplated meeting her, but every time I was ready, my kids would look at me. They had her face, her personality, her DNA, I couldn’t leave them. They were all I had left of her. It took years before I was able to function normally again. I even quit my job and lived off of savings and her life insurance for about a year. I was half the dad I used to be and only a fraction of my former self. Two years after her passing, I decided enough was enough and I kicked myself into gear. I found a job in a different city (closer to my parents), I packed my kids up, and I moved. Life was hard, but I kept chugging along and eventually I found some joy. A year after moving, I took a business trip to NY where I met my current girlfriend, L. While I acknowledged there was chemistry, I told her I was already married and she understood. However, a few months later I had to go back to NY where we met up again. I let my guard down for the first time around her. Before I knew it, she was putting in a transfer for my home branch and moving to my city. I fell in love with her and asked her out a year ago next month. My kids adore her and though she reminded them she will never take their moms place, they lovingly call her “momma L.” Today was the anniversary of my wife’s passing, an extremely hard day for all of us. This morning I walked into the living room to find L and my kids waiting for me. The kids were dressed in their church clothes with goofy smiles on their faces and bouquets in hand. Apparently, L came up with the idea of a picnic at my wife’s grave, an idea that the boys loved as they enjoy going to see their mom. While I was sleeping they prepared food and flowers, then insisted on wearing their best clothes. I’ll admit that I cried at the sight of them. I don’t know how I got this lucky twice in a row. I wanted my wife to meet this amazing woman, so I asked L to come along and she did. The day that I dread every year turned out to be a humbling reminder of the reason why I stayed on this planet.\n\nTo my lovely wife, you can never be replaced, but she is good to me and she takes care of our kids like you would. Thank you for sending her to me.",

Also because we know the whole truth now. She never talked about her brother much so all I knew was that he died. His birthday was the other week. My girl wanted to visit his grave because they haven’t done it in a while. She opened up about his car accident, being on life support until they decided to take him off it and since he was registered as an organ donor… That isn’t what got me thinking though. \n\nWhat did was the fact that the exact date of his death is when I got called in for the heart transplant. Me and my girlfriend decided to find out the truth because her family was grieving so much they never looked at the letter sent by me. We had a long talk with her mom about this because if she’d rather not know then we’ll drop it. Her mom gave us her blessing to find out. Luckily she never got rid of the letter only never got around to reading it because it was too painful, and that’s how we found out. \n\nIt was only my first name that I mentioned but I remembered every word I said on that letter. We cried for hours. All this time life brought us together in this crazy way and neither of us ever knew. It’s too wild.

      "body": "She is my neighbors only daughter and she’s about 14 years old. My neighbors were really struggling with her and how violent she got with them. She attacked her mom with a knife once but she thankfully didn’t sustain any serious injuries. My amazing neighbors did all they could to raise her well and spent so much time out of work taking care of her and putting all they effort they could to raise an autistic child. It was starting to damage their marriage.\n\nShe liked to come over and see our cat when we let him out. She never did anything but look at him and we even let her pet him a couple of times. One day, we couldn’t find our cat after letting him roam around so we thought he just wanted some extra time out. Well, on my way to go to the store, I saw our neighbors daughter inside my cats stomach, pulling all its insides out on her driveway. She also dismembered a lot of my cats body including its head. I immediately called my neighbor and told him what I saw. He was very sorry and felt really bad. I told him not to worry about it and that it’s not his fault. The police came shortly after because another neighbor reported the situation to 911. The cops were disturbed but understood the situation and took my request not to press charges on them. \n\nThat was the final straw for them. The violent and gory situation was too much for them and they couldn’t take any more chances, although they still loved her very much. Within the next month she was out of the home and living in a sort of group home for children with severe mental disorders. \n\nIt was really disturbing to see and it’s been on my mind a lot. My wife was devastated and we miss our kitty. He was our first pet and only pet. I’m not mad at the girl who did it, just sad that the condition she has has made her this way. \n\nThanks for hearing me out. It feels good to tell people this story.\n\nEDIT: We believes she might have some form of psychopathy and not just autism. I’m aware this is unusual for people that have autism alone. \nThank you all for the kind comments and reassurance. I really appreciate and think you all are awesome.",

      "body": "(You can find the original posts on my account page, Reddit won't let me link them.)\n\n\n\nI didn’t expect to have another update so quickly, but after posting my first update I did a lot of thinking about my kids. I ultimately decided that whatever else happened, I needed to warn Sophie about the situation, and do so immediately. To hell with Luke and whatever that meant for him. To hell if that meant all of the kids learned of the situation. She needed to be aware of what she might be getting herself into. \n\n\n\nSo I discreetly kept her out of school. We went back home, to our home, last night, and this morning, I dropped everyone off and saved Sophie for last, before driving right past her school and telling her that we needed to talk. Always a frightening thing for a teenager to hear from a parent, but I was quick to establish that she was not in trouble, but she needed to know the truth about why Amy and I were fighting, why her dating Tom was out of the question. I very gently explained that because of Luke’s closeness to Amy and Tom’s resemblance to him, I had come to suspect that perhaps Luke and Amy were intimate at some point over the years. If that was true, and there was any chance Tom’s father was actually Luke, that would be a significant problem. \n\n\n\nSophie was quiet during all of this, and even after I had stopped talking to let her respond, she paused for quite a while, before she finally said that we needed to get Tom and discuss this with him as well. I had no objections, so she texted him to meet with us. They’re both skipping school today, but Sophie gets straight As and this is extremely important, so I looked the other way. Tom came to meet us, and Sophie had me relay what I told her to him as well. I apologized to him for any indication I might have given that I didn’t think he was “good enough” for my daughter, and to both of them for not telling the truth sooner. \n\n\n\nTom and Sophie just gave each other this oddly knowing stare.\n\n\n\nAnd, Reddit, that’s when they blew my mind. \n\n\n\nSophie spoke first, with Tom backing her up. They revealed to me that in fact, they had already known about Luke and Amy, or at least they had strongly suspected. Apparently Tom has overheard conversations that are…questionable. As well as overhearing the sounds of sex from Amy’s room, sounds he would just as soon forget, but all signs point to Amy’s lover having been Luke. Tom had wondered for a very long time, and back in January, he finally voiced his fears to Sophie. She agreed with them. She could also see a strange sort of closeness between her father and his mother. They agreed that Luke was likely having an affair. They agreed that, because of Kaylee’s allergy, Luke might very well be her father. And if Kaylee was Luke’s daughter, the rest of Tom’s siblings could be Luke’s as well. Tom could be Luke’s kid himself. The math led them to the same places as me. \n\n\n\nSo Sophie and Tom came up with a little plan. As it turns out, they are not in love! They never were. They’re still just best friends. But they had the same instinct as me, that they didn’t want to blow up our entire family and social unit without more direct evidence (which Tom has been working on acquiring) and though Sophie very badly wanted to tell me the truth, she was hesitant because she knew it would shatter me. She had no idea I was already suffering in silence. Sophie apologized for not voicing her suspicions sooner. Honestly, we both cried, and I made sure she understood that none of this was her fault, and that I loved her very much. \n\n\n\nSo, the bottom line is, Sophie and Tom already know they could be half-siblings and aren’t actually interested in being a couple. That was their idea for how to rock the boat. To force Luke and Amy to do something about the situation rather than just keep making a fool out of me. I also think it was Tom/Sophie’s way of punishing them for their affair. Teenagers can be vindictive. So they concocted this idea that they wanted to date. Every flirtation I’ve witnessed, every inappropriate touch - all staged, apparently, and for the benefit of Luke, Amy, or both. This was supposed to make them sweat and Sophie/Tom expected they would jump out of their seats to forbid it from happening. When I was the one who did instead, that kind of threw the kids for a loop. They couldn’t understand why I cared more than the actual cheaters. They began to suspect that maybe I knew. Tom confronting me that one time about “Why can’t I date Sophie” was him trying to gauge if I knew or not. \n\n\n\nMaybe I shouldn’t be surprised. Sophie and Tom have always been close friends and confided in each other. Maybe I should be a little more concerned at how sneaky they’ve been, but honestly I’m just so relieved they’re not dating. (Sure, they could be lying to throw off the scent, I guess, but they apparently already knew that they’re likely related, they didn’t blink at all when I told them.) We even had a bit of a laugh together when Tom mentioned how he had been “a little offended” that I was so against him dating my daughter before. I kind of jokingly asked him, “So you don’t think she’s gorgeous?” And Tom, bless his heart, shrugged it off. “She is. But so is my English Teacher, and I’m not asking her out either.” \n\n\n\nEither way, the question now is…where to go from here? We have to figure that out. I will say that it is such a relief to have told Sophie and I feel like an elephant has taken one of its feet off my chest. Having her in my corner, and Tom in my corner as well, means a lot to me, and even though I basically just got it absolutely confirmed that Luke is sleeping with Amy…I kind of already knew that anyway. So now it’s just a question of how to proceed. Tom has already volunteered to submit his DNA so I can compare it to Luke’s, and both he and Sophie advise me not to tell Luke and Amy when I do this, which I agree with. They’re both completely on my side, which means more to me than I can ever express to them. Tom has also been trying to set up a camera in Amy’s room to catch her and Luke in the act. Sophie told me flat out that I needed to divorce her Dad, and hearing that from my own daughter made it clearer than it’s ever been. She’s right.",

      "title": "I, a student teacher, secretly corrected my student's spelling test so the class can get a pizza party",
      "body": "I started student teaching in a 4th-grade special ed class in September. My teacher told her students that if all 12 of them get 100% on their spelling tests, we can have a pizza party. So far, that has not happened yet. This past Monday, my teacher told them “This is Ms. K’s last week with us. Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party.” The kids were really excited. During their free time, they would all study their words. I never saw them work so hard.\n\nWhat makes this situation difficult is the bullying between Gabby and Sam. Sam has severe dyslexia and struggles with spelling. Gabby constantly picks on Sam for it. My teacher and school take this seriously and intervenes. However, Gabby still picks on Sam.\n\nAfter my teacher said “Let’s all work really hard to finally get that pizza party,” Gabby shouted back “Can you make sure that Sam studies since she’s really bad at spelling?” We addressed this with Gabby. Even though she is only 9, she pisses me off with her passive-aggressive comments. Sam practiced really hard for the spelling test. I even stayed after school Thursday to help Sam study.\n\nOn Friday morning right before the test, she was crying because she didn’t want to be the only student to fail and ruin the pizza party. I told her that she worked so hard this past week and she is smart.\n\nFor the spelling test, our teacher will say the spelling word out loud and the students will write it. 11 of the students have the same words. Sam has a slightly different set of words which are a bit easier. My teacher whispers Sam’s words to her. When the teacher does this, Gabby will sometimes snicker. I can’t fucking stand this. We addressed this before, but Gabby still doesn’t change her behavior.\n\nI finally lost it. This past Friday, Gabby snickered again. I went up to Gabby and angrily whispered “I will take your test and fail you right now if you don’t stop. And you will ruin the pizza party for everyone. Stop it.” She started crying in her seat. I didn’t care. Maybe it will finally get through to Gabby.\n\nOnce the kids are done, I walk around and collect all the tests. The kids go to lunch, and my teacher gives me the tests to grade. She leaves for lunch duty. I start grading each test and it's 100% after 100%. I am so proud of my students. I get to Gabby’s test and it's 100%. I finish grading and every single test is 100%. I feel so proud and excited for them. But then I realize, I only collected 11 tests. Sam’s test is on my teacher’s desk.\n\nI go through her test and she is spelling all the words correctly. I never felt so proud. But then, it hits me. The very last word which is always a “challenge word\" is spelled wrong. She wrote “because” as “becuase”. I am still proud of her because she got 9/10 correct. She never scored that high before. And sight words are very challenging. But all the students will figure out that Sam “ruined” the pizza party for them. Even if we don’t announce who failed, they will figure it out.\n\nI could talk to my teacher about letting them have the pizza party anyway- but my teacher is a stickler for the rules. “Everyone needs to get a 100%.” I can’t let Sam feel like a failure or get bullied. So, I erased the “u” and the “a” and switched them. Sam probably won’t notice. And I won’t tell Sam or she will feel bad. She will eventually learn how to spell \"because\". I need her to have her moment.\n\nThe kids came back from recess and were told the good news. They were so excited. Sam was so proud of herself! I come back on Monday for the pizza party!",

      "body": "I grew up in a very toxic, unstable environment. My dream is to find that feeling of home and have a space that’s stable, safe and secure. \n\nI somehow had this conversation of home the first night I ever met my now fiancé, when we were randomly talking about our childhood. I told him the concept of “home” is so important to me, and I’m very particular about the environment I live in. I can only hope that one day I can achieve that. \nMy fiancé owns a construction company, and we’ve been browsing houses to purchase over the last year, but none ever felt quite right. We viewed a piece of land out in the deep country last spring that is absolutely divine, and we talked about how we wished we could purchase it and build a dream home on it. I had never thought we could actually do it. \n\nLittle did I know, not long after my fiancé made the decision to purchase the land and start building.\nOur anniversary was this past weekend, and he told me he had a surprise for me. He blindfolded me, put me in the passenger seat and giggled like a 5 year old the whole way there. When I removed that blindfold and took in what I was looking at, I couldn’t even believe it. After asking “are you serious.....?” About 10 times, I started bawling. It has everything I’ve always talked about. A quaint, classic farmhouse design, a wrap around porch, a mud room at the front with a double entry like I’ve always said I wanted (it makes me feel safe, I don’t know why) and while it’s not quite finished like it was supposed to be yet, because of everything going on in the world, it’s absolutely perfect. I truly can’t believe I have this much good luck with this perfect man after spending a lifetime not knowing where home was, or how that felt. Now I know.",

      "body": "No one around me really seems to care, because if we are being honest, it’s not really that big a deal, especially because I am a grown man of 31yrs old. \nBut to me this has been such an invigorating achievement!\n  \n  \n All my life I have struggled with my reading, comprehension and learning. It’s not that I cannot read, I can, it’s just that it always feels like a huge chore, I get mixed up at times and have to re-read, and wherever possible I always avoid reading out loud, as some how I get things muddled up in my head and never read things accurately. I made my way through my school days always messing up and being teased and laughed at because of the slow pace of my reading. Because of this I made a big effort to make sure that as best I could I would never allow my professional career to be effected, I wanted to insure that all my emails and work would be of the highest standard, I wouldn’t allow myself to look stupid as an adult. Which for the most part I have been able to do, but a quick glance at my posts and comments will show that I am still prone to mistakes, which of course on Reddit means you are totally spell and grammar checked instantly and belittled if you slip up. Reading even on here mostly feels like work, it takes my brain a large amount of extra effort to accurately read anything, I get “strain” headaches and quickly tire when reading, even if it’s short titles on posts. \n \n \nSo for me reading has never been my idea of fun or enjoyable, it’s always been a step towards learning or work and I’ve never gotten beyond that with my attempts at reading for pleasure. I am a big fan of military history and of medical study to do with emergency medicine or first aid, I even studied at becoming a paramedic for a short time before my study opportunity was abruptly ended. So in a way I find those subjects the easiest to begin to read in. One of the first books I’ve ever read that wasn’t because of study or school, was The Diary of Anne Frank, it took me 2yrs to finish cover to cover, but I was 17yrs old and it was my first ever book away from school and I still felt accomplished! I found a series of books, 4 in total that were first hand fictional stories based around the real conquest of Genghis Khan, imagined stories about his planning and conversations etc. I took me 7yrs to complete the books, but at 26yrs I decided that recreational reading wasn’t for me. At age 29 after watching the series Band Of Brothers for about the 50th time, I brought myself Major Richard “Dick” Winters book, recounting the events of WWII from his vantage point. It combined my love of military history with my love of the TV series, and over a 6 month period I read the book. But it still really really took so much effort. \n \n \nNow with Covid-19 effecting everything, and a prolonged bout of severe illness on top of my disability, combined with a less than ideal living situation and battling my chronic depression after attempted suicide earlier in the year, I found myself with a tremendous amount of time, isolated in my tiny bedroom bored out of my mind which was further whittling at my mental health. I picked up a book entitled SAS: Ghost Patrol, which was a historic telling of the very beginnings of the SAS fighting with a special unit known as the Long Range Desert Group, who specialised in crazy daring deadly raids on the Nazis in Northern Africa during WWII, and focused on a hugely brave and bold attack on a Nazi port of Tobruk. I began reading, and soon I was realising that I was reading well into the early hours of the night, night after night! And just like that I had finished the book, in less than 3 weeks! I had actually thoroughly enjoyed it! Then I picked up the next, and then the next and soon within a short 8+/- weeks I had completed 3 books, three entire books read and most crucially ENJOYED! I am so excited and proud of myself! I just had to tell someone. I have just picked up my next booked entitled “March Battalion by Sven Hassel”!  Thank you for listening.\n \n \n \nEdit: Wow! This has blown up far beyond what I ever thought possible! Thank you so so much to everyone for sharing such kindness and support! It’s a bit overwhelming. I have tried and will try to get a reply to everyone who comments, but incase I don’t I hope no body is upset, because there is hundreds of comments and I am struggling to read them all in a timely fashion! Also a big big thank you to everyone for the awards, I received my first platinum award today, which is just WOW! Thank you! \n\nAlso I’ve found a link to a website with simulates what it can be like for those of us with dyslexia or other learning difficulties when trying to read.

      "body": "First, a few points to answer from the comments. \n\n\n\nI don’t have any DNA test results back yet. That can take weeks. But now that I know Sophie is in no danger of dating a relative, the pressure is off. I’ll get into this momentarily, but, it frankly no longer matters if Luke fathered the children. \n\n\n\nI highly, highly doubt my father-in-law is having an affair with Amy. At worst, he might know (or even just suspect) the truth about Amy and Luke. But it’s also possible that he just refuses to believe they would do such a thing. I’ve been vague about details for privacy, but to put it very simply, Jim and Amy are both pretty white. Cat and Luke are not. Had Jim fathered Amy’s babies, they would look different than they do. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, I do have an update. While a stream of comments have called me spineless and naive, called me a “sister wife” (as an ex Mormon, that hits a particular nerve)  and most recently, a stream of comments have said my story is fake (fair enough, it’s the internet, but Luke is not the first scumbag husband to have two families.) Several other comments have been incredibly kind and supportive and I really appreciate that. Apologies if I haven’t responded to a comment or direct message that you sent. I covered as many as I could but I was literally getting hundreds, so I definitely missed several of them. \n\n\n\nFirst thing’s first. I discussed this in the comments, but our little “team” has (supposedly) recruited my mother in law. I say “supposedly” because Sophie and Tom were going to talk to her about getting help with submitting the DNA test and, at the advice of my lawyer, I am staying out of the process. Officially, I told Sophie not to do it, and she said she wouldn’t. MIL hasn’t contacted me about it either. (Though we have been in touch, I’ll get into that more in a moment.) The bottom line is that I can honestly say I had no knowledge of any DNA test. Loophole city. \n\n\n\nAnother bit of good news. I was digging through the paperwork in preparation for my divorce, wanting to get a head start against Luke, and one thing that came to my attention is that my name is on the paperwork for our home. Luke’s name is not. I was the one who bought the house and we always planned to add Luke onto the paperwork at some point, but we never got around to it and eventually the idea was forgotten. It was my lawyer, “Paige” who pointed this out to me, and it was like finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground. I don’t know where I’d be without Paige. She’s a dear friend from college who I reached out to, hat in hand, for help. She’s been there for me this past week not just as legal counsel but as a friend I really needed right now. \n\n\n\nThe thing is, she’s not “our” lawyer, me and Luke. We have our own “family” attorney who has helped us out of jams in the past (we clashed with our HOA a few years ago, not worth getting into right now) but Paige is a lawyer who specializes in family law and has handled divorces before. Luke remembers her from college and knows she went into law but doesn’t know she’s a divorce attorney. So I can have her over for coffee like we’re “catching up” and he has no idea anything is going on. Turns out, he’s not the only one who can harbor someone under his spouse’s nose under the guise of being a “friend.” \n\n\n\n**So. Onto the update…**\n\n\n\nThe last time I looked in Luke’s phone was three months ago, around the point Sophie and Tom began to go around claiming they wanted to date. I found nothing. While I know how to search for recently deleted photos and didn’t see any, my comments taught me how to find recently deleted messages. So, when Luke was asleep, I did just that. Swiped his phone and brought it downstairs, checked recently deleted. I am glad I did but I also wish I had not, because I’m still reeling from the pain. Sure enough, a conversation with Amy had been deleted. Recent texts talking about the conflict between her and me, with Amy describing me as a “problem” and Luke trying to pacify her - without defending me at all, to be clear. They both alluded to how they had “expected” this for a while and just hoped it would never happen - presumably me accusing them of having an affair. While the whole conversation and the fact that it was deleted was sketchy, nothing was actually admitted. So I scrolled a bit higher, to a few days before the fight. Amy’s messages got a bit more flirty. Then. I saw it. Five days before I confronted them, Amy had sent Luke a topless pic. A selfie with no shirt or bra. \n\n\n\nGuys, I teared up. I knew it was true, I knew it in my bones, but seeing the proof still cut me like a hot knife. (Doesn’t help that Amy’s always had bigger breasts than me.) I exited the messages app and checked Luke’s recently deleted photos. Sure enough, the same selfie was there, and others. Amy topless, Amy naked, in various poses to show off. There were pictures of the two of them together, cuddled and pressed close like a couple. In some of these, she was naked. In some, they both were. There were videos. Amy sent Luke a video message of herself topless, and I had to actually hear her voice talking to him in a tone that made me sick, about how she was sending him a quick video to “help him get through the day.” In more than one video, she called him her “boo” and, hearing her call him that, I almost vomited. Stopped looking at that point, I’d seen enough. For about five minutes anyway, then a strange compulsion to keep searching led me to check Luke’s laptop. I knew enough of his passcodes to access his iCloud storage and…yeah, basically more of the same. \n\n\n\nThere were letters, long letters between them. I didn’t have the heart to read past the first few lines of one of them, but I did read Luke mention “our children.” There were countless naked/topless selfies of Amy. Selfies of them together. Videos where Amy appeared to be masturbating. There were sex tapes. Of the two of them. Tom had previously offered to try and hide a camera in Amy’s room, but fuck, he never needed to. Luke was hiding a whole treasure trove under my nose all along. I scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled. There were so many. Going back years. Not all of it was even sexual. There were some photos of Amy’s kids, too. One video was of Kaylee and the twins playing together when they were younger, and Luke and Amy’s voices from behind the camera. There were even old pictures of Luke and Amy from when they were younger. I’d even say teenagers. \n\n\n\nI snapped. All these years, I had been telling myself I had to be wrong, that it couldn’t be true. Well, it was true. I know that no one forced me to look at as much of the evidence as I did, but I’m still hurting very badly from having seen it and in that moment, I wanted to act, so I did. I called my lawyer, who is a remarkable woman. It was the middle of the night, so I had to call her twice, and she picked up. Though I had woken her, when I asked her to come by and said it was an emergency, she agreed. I also asked her to draw up the paperwork and have it ready. She told me that she’d already had it ready since I first reached out to her. As I waited for her, I went through the necessary channels on Luke’s laptop to make sure he wouldn’t be able to remotely disconnect our access to his little stash, changing passwords and all that. My lawyer (Let’s call her “Paige”) arrived, and I went outside to greet her in the car. Spent a good half hour in the passenger seat just crying, and she was great about that, before I passed her Luke’s phone and his laptop, with all the information she needed to use them. She warned me that this could be considered theft. So I asked her to forward and print out copies of everything she could and then bring the items back, because I just couldn’t bear to do it myself. She agreed. \n\n\n\nI went back inside, and then, I packed up Luke’s things while the house slept. At one point Owen got up to use the bathroom and asked me what I was doing, but I told him I was just cleaning. Luke stirred once or twice while I was in the bedroom but did not wake. I got all of his things packed into trash bags and I loaded up the car. That’s when I woke him up, and told him to come outside. He was confused and half asleep, but he did notice things were missing. I ignored his questions and just told him to come with me. So he followed me outside. Once we were by the car, I pulled out the divorce papers and officially handed them to him. That was about when he figured out what I was doing, and he tried to talk me out of it. Tried to be sweet with me, to be tender. He kept insisting that he loved me and that there had never been anything with Amy. Kept trying to persuade me not to tear our family apart. Even two weeks ago, I might have wilted under him because the manipulation and gaslighting were truly masterclass, but I can see through it now. I didn’t tell him that I knew he was full of shit, I didn’t tell him what I had seen, I just told him we were finished. He tried a different approach. He refused to go. Stated firmly that our children were his too, and that even if we were separating, I had no right to just decide the kids would stay with me over him. This was where I very coldly presented the paperwork reminding him that the house is in my name, and told him under no circumstances would my kids be staying with Amy. He argued a while longer, but in the end he decided to be the “bigger person” and “keep the peace.”At that moment I didn’t care where he went. Before he left, he did ask about his phone and laptop, and I waved him off by saying they were in one of the bags. Bought a little time. \n\n\n\nI couldn’t sleep for the rest of that night. I cried more. Eventually I realized I’d have to wake my children up early and explain to the extent that I could. Naturally, I woke Sophie first. I told her that I had kicked her father out, and that I had discovered evidence of an affair on his devices. I did not specify what kind of evidence and she did not ask. I woke up the others and gently told them that their Dad had gone to stay somewhere else for a while. That I wasn’t sure where, but from now on things were going to be different. Louise was the one to ask if we were getting divorced, and I couldn’t lie to her. I told her yes. Owen asked when they could see their father again and I wanted to cry. Sophie was a very big help, urging her siblings to be sympathetic to me right now and worry about Dad later. I knew better than to “poison” them against their father (Paige warned me against doing that as well) so I only told Sophie that the affair was confirmed since she had already been in the know. However, as the kids were getting ready for school, Owen approached me and asked me point blank if it was about Amy. If Luke was going to be with her instead of me. I couldn’t answer, but I suppose that’s an answer on its own. \n\n\n\nGot the kids to school, and my next step was calling to have the locks changed. I knew Luke would be back for his devices before long, but thankfully Paige returned with them before he showed up again. It was a very quick visit. She just told me that all was accomplished, and she had records of everything we would need in court. Sure enough, Luke turned up an hour later demanding to know where his laptop and phone were. I had set them back in our bedroom like they had never moved, and I just told him he had forgotten them. He insisted that I had said they were in one of the bags, so I just shrugged him off and told him I “must have been mistaken.” After he grabbed them, he tried again to reason with me, but I just showed him the door. I knew the kids would start to come home from school before long and I think he was trying to delay leaving so he could see them. I was not having it. I started shouting again and sent him on his way. I’m still just in absolute pain and despair for what I saw. I don’t know if he’ll realize that anyone went through his devices and made copies of the evidence, or if he suspects I saw anything, but he obviously didn’t say so. After he left, I cried once again. \n\n\n\nTalked to my mother in law that night. Apparently Luke did show up to his parents’ house, which was a surprise, as I was so certain he’d stay with Amy. But maybe even he knows how suspicious that would look to the children and doesn’t want to rock the boat as much. Maybe he knows I’m more likely to let my children see their grandmother than Amy at this point, and he wants to see them to give his version of events. That is not happening. Cat already shared his version with me, that he relayed to her and Jim. That I’m having some kind of mental breakdown, that he wishes he could help me, but my paranoia is causing me to lash out and turn violent. (I was never violent. I shoved him away when he tried to hold me, that is all.) And what’s so hilarious is that he didn’t mention Amy at ALL to his parents. He didn’t even frame it as me “falsely” believing he was having an affair. Even though that’s his story when talking to ME, he left Amy out of it when talking to his parents. Cat noticed that. She believes me. Jim doesn’t know what to believe anymore. According to Cat, he seemed very, very troubled by what he heard from all sides.\n\n\n\nAs for Amy, she’s radio silent. Tom has told Sophie that she’s acting like nothing is wrong but is clearly stressed out. That when her children ask, she makes the same sort of claims. That I am having some kind of emotional, nervous breakdown, and pushing her away, as well as Luke. She doesn’t mention anything about my accusing them of an affair, but still puts it all on me. Amy has not reached out to talk to me directly, and I have not tried talking to her since our big argument. I haven’t really told my kids anything, just that I’m having disagreements with Luke and Amy - though I was very clear that it is NOT a question of my mental health. Honestly, I think they all kind of know what’s going on. Sophie continues to be my rock, as I try to be for her and the others, and Tom continues to be our spy in the ranks. Right now, my biggest regret is the stress that all of this is causing on the children, which I knew it would, but it still needed to be done. \n\n\n\nMy life has fallen apart. But it was never my life.",

      "body": "We live in a rural area where all the water comes from each house’s individual water well. These wells cost upwards of $20K to drill.

It was going to cost anywhere from $3000-$5000.\n\nMy husband had the day off work (he was on standby for call outs) and he was bored, and decided to watch you tube videos on replacing pumps.

Ok, maybe not that flawlessly- having to slide down the rope and back up to catch the pipe so we don’t lose it down hole- but by God- we pulled all that pipe out, got a new pump from our water guy, wired it up, then sent it all back down home. And it freaking worked!!!! We got our water back last night, and we didn’t screw it up! My husband saved us $5000 at a time we didn’t have it to spare. And the kids are now making jokes about starting our own water well service. My husband is a ballsy, confident man- but in a good way. I’m a lucky woman.",

      "title": "Finally cured my bad breath after 11 years!",
      "body": "I was so excited when I finally figured it out that I thought it would be appropriate to share it with others. I have personally been struggling with bad breath since I was 10 years old for several reasons.\n\nWhen I was 10, I had tonsil stones and didn't really know what they were. At that age, I thought that it was food coming back up, so I ignored it for 6 years, until I did my research in high school. I removed them myself thinking that it would help, but it actually made it worse. I was bullied by others who continuously commented \"Your breath smells like sh\\*t.\" At that point, I begged my mother to take me to an ENT and scheduled an appointment to get my tonsils removed. The doctors told me that they should have been removed years ago because they were \"highly infected.\" After I got them removed, I thought I was home free to continue brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash with no bad breath. WRONG!\n\nAfter I got my tonsils removed, I still had bad breath. I researched again and decided to buy a tongue scrapper, but it didn't work. I was at a standstill again for about another couple of years until I looked up that the ingredient in most toothpaste was sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which can dry your mouth out. I did have dry mouth, so I started focusing on buying toothpaste without that ingredient. I also started using alcohol free mouthwash, and it still didn't work. I was back on the path of spending lots of money buying different products that had no effect on me.\n\nI later researched that post nasal drip could cause bad breath, which I had. I went to the doctor, and they told me to buy over the counter nasal spray. I used it thinking that it was all over. NOPE!\n\nFrom there, I thought that everything was coming from my stomach because my oral health was not the problem at this point, so I started eating healthy foods in hopes that it would help, but it didn't.\n\nThen, I started flossing after every meal, and it only helped temporarily, so I knew there was another problem.\n\nI kept reading forums online about people who cured their bad breath, and I read across someone who said that they started using oral probiotics that contained BLIS M18. I bought several bottles hoping that this would finally be my eureka... It wasn't. That, too, was also a temporary solution.\n\nAfter everything I tried, I thought there was no hope for me, but then I came across the post that talked about using diluted hydrogen peroxide (HP) as a mouthwash. My dentist makes me use diluted HP every time I came in, so I figured it was safe. I brushed and flossed like I normally did and then swished to solution in my mouth, even brushed it on my tongue, and IT WORKED! I finally had a long term effect. For the rest of the day, my breath was fine. I didn't think it was possible. Then, the next morning, I woke up with very little morning breath when it's usually very bad in the morning. I don't use the solution daily, only when I feel the need to. I'm hoping that my post will reach someone because I have struggled with this for most of my life, and it has really dampened my confidence, but not anymore. If I can figure it out, then you can too.\n\nEDIT: OMG! Thank you guys for the support! I honestly didn't think this would get this much recognition lol\n\nFor those wondering, I used half and half for the HP solution. I literally bought the store brand kind, and it worked for me. I used to 3% in the brown bottle that you can buy in the store. You can dilute it more if you feel the need to. I also still use the oral probiotics occasionally. You can look up any online that have BLISH M18 in it. Most of them have good reviews.\n\nWhen it comes to the process, I floss and brush first. I personally use Sensodyne since it doesn't have SLS in it (at least the one I used). From there, I take the half and half solution and swish and gargle it for 30 - 45 seconds. Then, I rinse it with water to make sure it's all out. I also put some on my toothbrush and scrub my tongue with it. Sometimes I use the chewable oral probiotics afterwards if I felt the need to.\n\nAlso, I don't smoke, I hardly drink coffee, I eat fairly healthy, I don't have diabetes or tonsils anymore, so some may have other issues than me.",

I can’t help but to find it pathetic.",

      "body": "I really want to type this out so that I can read it back one day, so here goes.\n\nToday is the 2 year anniversary of my dad’s death. I am staying with my grandparents (dad’s side) right now because long story short after my dad’s death my mom started seeing a guy who, imo, clearly prefers my brother, and mom’s new bf & I can’t live in the same house. I love my mom but I’m old enough now for her to respect my decision to live with my grandparents for the summer.\n\nToday was an emotional day of course. My grandmom is very sentimental and recently she has been putting together photo albums, one of my dad, one of his brother, of me, and of my brother. Today my grandmom and I were looking through the one of my dad, the bulk of which is photos of him as a kid/teen when he lived with my grandparents but has a few more recent photos. \nOne of these recent photos caught my attention.\n\nSee I have JME (type of epilepsy) that gives me these occasional “jerks” or spasms in my arms and legs. Because of this I’ve never been able to go in water so I never learned to swim. Despite this we went to the beach a lot as a family (CA residents, lol).\n\nThe photo that stood out to me was one of my dad in his 20s, so a bit before I was born, treading water in the ocean, clearly very deep in. My grandmother told me that his brother took the photo when the two of them + their then-girlfriends went cliff diving. I said, but dad couldn’t swim? She was confused and said of course he could, did I really think he was the kind of person to not know how to swim?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, on our frequent family visits to the beach, my dad had told me he couldn’t swim as he was scared of the water so could I keep him company on the beach? This had been great for me of course, as I didn’t want to be alone while my mom and brother went swimming, and we would find other games and things to do while they were in the ocean. To be honest it had always seemed silly to me that he was scared of water, he was a marathon runner / generally very sporty person who grew up in California so I didn’t get why he never just learned. But now I realise that of course he could swim. He knew I didn’t want to be a liability because of my condition, that if I thought he wanted to go I would tell him to go without me and leave me behind, so he told me he couldn’t swim.\n\nHe didn’t think I’d ever find out what a nice thing he was doing for me and yet he still did it every time. Especially today, that sent me over the edge. Thank you dad.\n\n\nedit: typo - my dad’s brother took the pic, not my brother. My brother is 15, lol",

      "body": "Waiting to downvoted since this is a male dominated website but whatever.\n\nIf you have ever openly declared yourself as preferring ass over tits (or vice versa) as well as openly stated that your prefer \"big\" or \"small\" whatever then you have no right to complain when women state their preferences. If you have ever made fun of a woman for being fat, having small breasts, having a small butt etc. then you have no right to complain when someone says the same kind of remarks about penis size, height, or strength. There is nothing wrong with having a preference there is something wrong with creating a hierarchy about uncontrollable factors such as body parts. If you have ever used cruel terms like roast beef lips, pancake tits, pepperoni nipples (isn't it amazing how many terms we have used to reduce women to a consumable product) then you have no right to complain when others are critical towards your physical appearance. I think it's unnecessary and immature when people both male and female accuse people of having a small penis, however usually the first thing that a woman is attacked about is her appearance as well so your experience isn't unique. Don't want to be reduced to your penis size? Don't reduce women. You may say that you have had women lose interest once they found out your height or penis size, and once again your experience is not unique. Many women are turned down due to their weight and level of perceived beauty. Never ever have I seen a man's accomplishments be belittled or undermined by how \"fuckable\" they are perceived as. Don't want people to be judgmental towards you? Then stop judging others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for every comment, upvote, and award. I wanted to offer a different perspective and am happily surprised to see such a positive reaction overall to a such a societal conundrum. I think we all just want to feel appreciated and valuable, so we all should try harder to facilitate that for others. Being able to appreciate the diversity of beauty in return increases our own.",

      "body": "No one put a gun to my head. I wasn't smuggled into doing this work and it all happened in a free country, in a legitimately run studio easily recognized for producing hardcore content. \n\n\nNo one tells you how awkward and intimidating it is, especially when you're an 18 year old girl, surrounded by a roomful of casting agents, executives and producers/directors all men of course just pushing their own degrading YET PROFITABLE agendas, but they polish it, they sell and pitch it well, especially if you're young, they talk to you in a way that it only makes sense to an 18 year old. Looking back in recollection, it's all very patronizing \n\n\nThey'll have you believing your own non existant hype in exchange for taking your identity, ruining your body and sacrificing your sanity and ultimately your soul. But you will “look so hot” and “be such a bad b” is what they tell you\n\n\nNo one tells you that they don't actually care that you are coked out your mind during filming and that the directors actually PREFER THAT YOU ARE HIGH so they can coerce (in their words “direct”) you to do things you'd never usually do like multiple penetrative gang anal, being urinated on, throated, bukkake, all of the degrading abusive genres\n\n\n If you're not a big name performer and just starting in this industry the pressure to do extreme is PUSHED ASSERTIVELY because they know you are naïve or easily intimidated because you are new, but the truth is, it's because they can PAY YOU FAR LESS than they do for big name performers that can afford to demand premium pay to do extreme scenes. \n\n\nSo basically as a porn rookie your underpaid ripped, infected asshole, mouth and vagina are essentially only about profit and economics for these studios. \n\n\nThere is no drug testing, you just sign a form to verify that you are not high, but often times you are  INSTRUCTED by directors and PA's themselves NOT to fill out that you're high. \n\n\nThey film a “consent” video to verify that you were ok with whatever transgressions happened to your body, but is it really consent if you're threatened that you won't get paid while the directors/production assistants guilt trip you about wasted filming/crew time or constantly yell at you to cooperate and consent?\n\n\nDo you know how AWFUL it is watching yourself being gang banged/raped when you are clean, sober and having little recollection of it happening? \n\n\nDo you know what it's like constantly fearing having ANY intimacy with ANYONE because they think they have the absolute right to abuse you because they saw it happen to you in a video. \n\n\nEven worse is me knowing my abuse is freely available to view out there for any young people to watch and form toxic ideas about sex and non consent. \n\n\nI Iive inside this nightmare EVERY SINGLE DAY! \n\n\nThe studios do not care that you are broken, theyve made THEIR own BIG PAYOUT off MY name, MY body, MY degredation. In exchange for what? $1000, $1500 per shoot so I can afford medical expenses for my grandmother, fix my car, pay my bills, feed a destructive drug habit, to live... in exchange for getting my anus ripped apart by strangers so many times that I need to inject it with Botox in order to heal and not defecate involuntarily in public?\n\nNever mind what I will need to heal my mind, because I'm so far gone that may never heal. \n\n\n If you think this industry helps performers with healthcare, that's a joke since THERE IS ZERO HEALTH CARE OR PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORTS FOR PORN ACTORS. ZERO! \n\n All they care about is sti testing and even on that front there are so many flaws and loopholes and lies. \n\n\nI cannot tell anybody how or why or why not to use porn, that is everyone's personal choice \n\n\nbut if this, THIS is what you find entertaining, please understand there is a very steep price people out here have paid with their bodies and soul, for your 5 minutes of empty pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit; I am overwhelmed by the kindness and positivity so many of you have messaged me with and much thanks to those who've awarded my post.\n\nThis post was purely meant as a cathartic release in the form of words and I'm thankful there are platforms like this one for venting in such an unfiltered way\n\nEven though I no longer participate in the industry I am by no means anti porn, many people who choose to do porn do so for their own reasons that's not for me to judge. Yes, I've met a few very rare people in the business who are genuinely good. This was my own experiences within the trade, but I do believe the industry does have a responsibility to look out for the interest of their sex workers, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG OR NEW PEOPLE, and not manipulate them",

But I’ll leave that .01% for the chance that I fall in love with the perfect man and magically change my mind. We as women don’t OWE anyone an explanation, but I’ve completed a list of every reason I do not want children, hopefully I don’t forget any. \n\n-I do NOT have a maternal bone in my body. Screaming children make me homicidal. Kids having a tantrum make me want to drop kick them, not coddle them. \n\n-I don’t want to be pregnant.\n\n-I don’t want to experience morning sickness (not everyone gets it, but I have no desire to test that theory)\n\n-I don’t want to give up alcohol for 9 months \n\n-I don’t want to go through labor\n\n-I don’t want to gain weight and get more stretch marks \n\n-I don’t want to give birth, I don’t want to tear, I don’t want to poop on the table \n\n-I don’t want to deal with the vaginal recovery of birth. You don’t just snap back to normal, you bleed and look fucked up for weeks\n\n-I don’t want to have to not have sex while recovering and have to deal with a “husband who has needs”. I just pushed a fucking baby out of my vagina go get a fleshlight. \n\n-many husbands cheat on their pregnant spouses. I don’t want to be cheated on in general, but the pain seems worse when you’re carrying someone’s child and have to still give birth to and raise that child \n\n-I don’t want to deal with sleepless nights. \n\n-I don’t want to fight with my spouse over who has to get up to take care of a middle of the night screaming baby \n\n-I don’t want a relationship to suffer because I feel like I’m doing a majority of the caretaking when it is BOTH of our child  \n\n-I don’t want to clean explosive diarrhea diapers\n\n-I don’t want to deal with every fucking stomach bug kids bring home from school each year \n\n-I don’t want to spend my hard earned money on anything other than myself or those I choose to spend it on. NOT on someone I HAVE to spend it on \n\n-I don’t want to deal with tantrums in public OR at home \n\n-I don’t want to do any of it. I don’t want to sacrifice my life to raise a baby. I just dont. I’m sure there’s a lot more I forgot about. I see the value in having a family. I would date someone with a child from a previous relationship. But I have no desire to grow and birth a child or raise one. \n\nPeople feel all of these things. And to question anyone on why they don’t want kids is just rude. Think about all these points. They’re valid. No woman should HAVE to deal with ANY of these things if she doesn’t want to. PERIOD.",

      "body": "Dear wife,\n\nI first met you when I was 19. I’m 34 now, but I still remember the moment I laid eyes on you. You know how people say, “It was love at first sight?” Well, I used to think it was a stupid overused cliché, but it happened to me that night. You were a Renaissance painting come to life, with your emerald green eyes, smooth, opal-like skin, and wavy blue-black hair. Your voice was like bells pealing. Your smile, radiant and glowing. \n\nI was your first kiss. I was your first boyfriend, your first love, your first everything. We dated for 2 years before you broke up with me for the first time, over some silly argument I don’t even remember. We were split for a year, and then you came back into my life.\n\nWe dated for nearly 3 years this time around before you broke up with me again when I was 25. You were scared by how fast our relationship was moving and wanted to be free. So I let you be free, but God, how it hurt me. We were practically engaged by that time. I was sketching out designs for a ring.\n\nI dated other women, but none of them were like you. You also dated other people, some good men, some mediocre, and some really, really bad. You cried in my arms after one of your boyfriends had yelled at you and left bruises on your cheeks. \n\nBut one day, less than 2 years after we had last broken up, you told me you were engaged (to one of the good ones). I went to your wedding. You looked like a Queen, every bit as beautiful as the day I first met you. How your face lit up as you saw your soon to be husband! I always thought, that when I attended your wedding, I would be the groom.\n\nWedded bliss didn’t last long for you. After just a few months of marriage, your husband passed in a tragic accident. You miscarried your child. This sent you spiraling into a whirlwind of depression, anxiety, and opioid addiction. Yet I stood by you. I watched as you buried your husband and your unborn child, I watched as you collapsed onto the ground, watering the fresh earth with your tears.\n\nSome years later, we reconnected. You were recovered now, and more like the girl you once were. Your laughs were fewer and far in between, but they were still there. Your once youthful and innocent eyes were harder now, more weary, tired. But despite all this, despite everything, I still loved you.\n\nAnd deep down, you loved me too. For the second time before you turned 30, you were married. To me, this time. Sometimes, it hardly feels real. I wake up in the middle of the night and hear you breathing beside me, and a wave of pure joy washes over me when I realize that it’s you.\n\nStill, I know that I don’t have your heart completely. I know your heart is fragmented, and a piece of it is buried in a small graveyard by the sea. Your name is written on that tombstone as well, with your year of birth and a foreboding blank space after the hyphen. Some nights you wake up crying, and you will not tell me why, but I know why. Sometimes I know that when I wrap my arms around you, you close your eyes and pretend that it’s him.\n\nI know that, and it’s alright. I love you, and that’s all that matters, so long as you love me too. Love is an infinite resource, and your love for him cannot deplete your love for me. I know that.",

      "body": "My name is Amelie (26) and I have a 5-year-old son. My ex-husband (29) cheated on me with his co-worker, Bethany (28). I was 2 months pregnant with our second child when I found out. Bethany was going to have his child. I miscarried; my ex left the house to be with her. It's been 2 years since it was born. My Mother-in-law has been supportive of me and has had nothing to do with my Ex or his mistress and their child. Up until a few months ago.\n\nI adore my In-laws and we're extremely close. My MIL and Parents are the best of friends. She loves me and her grandson more than anything. This infuriates my ex-husband's affair partner. My in-laws cut contact with them straight away. Bethany was jealous that her child would never know the love of grandparents. At least her son has a father. This brings us to the problem. Unfortunately, my MIL has been very ill for a while and so she's updated her will. My ex-husband was an only child, so he would get everything. But now, my son will inherit her house, villa and money. I will receive a large portion of her money and all of her belongings. Until my son turns 18, it will be in my trust. If I pass before that, my Parents will take care of it. They do not know this.\n\nThe thing is, once they caught wind of her being ill, my ex-husband begged for forgiveness. The mistress started being nice towards her (she's started fights and called her horrible names before) and forced her to be around his baby. My mother-in-law is bed bound, but she says she wants to leave with a bang so she'll endure this. I haven't encouraged her to do anything and this is her choice alone. They want her money, and her son thinks he is still included in the will. He also thinks his child will now be acknowledged by his grandmother and will also receive money. Now, my MIL hasn't actually said she's forgiven them. She despises her son and his mistress for tearing apart our family. She wants to reward those who deserve it, and get revenge in one go. The mistress keeps on hinting on how her child will grow up and attend a great college etc. (Money involved things) whenever she's around my MIL. Actually, MIL's niece (my cousin by marriage) has overheard her on the phone discussing what wallpaper she wants in the dining room when she 'moves in' and how my MIL has no taste whatsoever. She also mentioned how she'll finally be able to take down pictures of my son when my ex owns the house.\n\nToo bad for her, it will belong to my son. No changes will be made until my son becomes 18. It's his grandmother's home and he should be allowed to cherish it in the way she's decorated it. I'm not really allowed to tell anyone, and though this revenge will be satisfying, I'll have to lose my Mother-in-law. It's kind of a win-lose situation and I dread the day when she'll take her last breath. She means a lot to me, I love her. She wants this for her grandson, and has said that she cannot rest until she knows her son and his mistress have been punished. She wants this because her childhood was also ruined because of her father and his affair partner. She wants my son to know he was loved and will always be loved. I hope my son will always value the great women in his life. I wish he had more time with his grandmother.\n\nI might make an update if anyone wants it, though I pray to God it's a long time before that.\n\nEdit: I thought this post would attract just a handful of people but wow! Thank you all for listening to me and giving me advice. As for those who are angry at me for not asking my MIL to include my ex's new child, I can't do anything about that. Yes, I'm happy, and that's selfish, but I'm going to put myself and my son first. That child contributed to my miscarriage and is one of the reasons why my son has not had a father for over 2 years. I can't change my MIL's mind about him. I do pity the baby, but it's not up to me to fend for it. It's not my responsibility. I've tried talking to my MIL but she's had her whole childhood ruined because her father made his affair children his top priority. This is why she wants nothing to do with it or her son. He knows that she went through so much because of cheaters. Yet he decided to do the same to her. He has seen his grandfather favor his aunt and uncle over his mother. If this happened to you, you wouldn't be so happy about sharing yet ANOTHER thing with the baby. Thank you again to those who have listened to me, and I've read out the nice comments to my MIL. We've had a great laugh together.\n\nEdit 2: The mistress would send me photos of her ultrasounds after I miscarried. Either to me or to my family. In the first envelope, she sent a letter full of the nastiest things about me, my son and my miscarried baby. She'd even tagged me on social media on an account I didn't know about. It was an invitation to her Baby Shower. She has done plenty of disgusting and hurtful things to me regarding my miscarried baby. The people who are coming at me in the comments would not be as civil as me if anything like that happened to them. Ignoring her child is honestly the best option. I do not want my son to grow up with her son. And to those who are insulting and saying rude things about my dying Mother in Law, you are truly disgusting.",

      "body": "A few months ago we met at the gas station. She didn’t have any money on her and she was trying to get to a bus stop a few blocks away. I drove her on the way we were chatting about everything. We really got along and after finding out she didn’t have anywhere to go I asked her if she’d like me to get her something to eat. \nBut I just wanted an excuse to keep talking to her because we had so many things in common and I enjoyed our conversation. Her story and how badly things have gone for her personal life ever since the pandemic. \nAt one point I remember her asking if this is okay (she was about to kiss me). I told her it was more than fine and we kissed. One thing led to another and we had sex in my car. \n\nWe saw eachother a few more times at coffee shops to talk over the next weeks until she told me she found a job an hour away and it was also close to a shelter until she could afford her own place to live. That’s a little bit of our background story so you see how it got to this. \nFirst time in months she contacts me that she’s over 4 months pregnant with our baby. It caught her by surprise and she says she was so stressed with work it didn’t really hit her until she remembered we had sex. \n\nI’m a little overwhelmed ( I have proof the baby is mine). She said she understands if I don’t want to be involved with the way it all happened. I don’t feel that way at all. It’s scary but once I actually saw the ultrasound photo of our baby my heart fluttered. \n\nI’m a dad. No idea how we’re going to work this out but I plan to be there for my kid. Just wanted to say it all somewhere before the time comes to tell everyone else in my life",

He kept repeating \"Kitty's gone\" and \"I don't have Kitty anymore.\"\n\nI toughed it out and didn't cry the whole time including when I and another coworker walked him home - and my other coworker stayed with Brian to have dinner and watch a movie with him, cause he knows Brian likes Pokémon and he likes Pokémon too.\n\nBut yeah now I'm at home and bawling my eyes out too. That was genuinely the saddest thing I have ever had to do. Poor Brian.

He said that boys would like me more and that he had made me more feminine and pretty. He didn’t ask me about it, he just did it. Forever altered my teeth without my consent because I was a female. I went home and cried, I didn’t know how to tell my parents so I didn’t until much later and it was way too long after to do anything about it, I was 12 so I don’t blame myself, but I do wish I had stood up for myself.

      "body": "Hello,\n\nI’ve never really written my whole story and before I go I wanted to have someone remember who I was, even if it’s a series of anonymous redditors. This is going to be a long read and I apologize in advance.\n\nI was born into a wealthy family in managment of a household corporation from the part of the world I was originally from (East Asia). My father was a cruel man who often abused my mother and I ferociously. Despite all his shortcomings, he tried to groom me into becoming a good man who would one day lead the company he built from nothing. As the years dragged on his health declined.\n\nWhen I was twelve, he passed away and it was said he worked himself to death. Flying between America and Korea mustn’t have been easy for him as he often seemed ill especially during the finals few months of his life. \n\nIn the years after my father’s passing, my mother took on the role of shaping me into a future corporate leader by having me educated at the best schools in America. Those years were hell for me as everyday I missed my home and all the friends I’ve left behind in my home. However, despite despising school, I made good marks and was moderately received by my teachers. \n\nFor my final year of high school as I was slotted to graduate early, I requested to be transferred to a sister school across the country. That’s when I met the only person I’ve ever loved. She was a student at the school, an underclassman and a scholarship student of my nationality. Despite what my culture would’ve perceived as shortcomings, such as her family status, I loved her. Till this day she is the kindest person I’ve ever met in my life and one of a few people who truly wants to be my friend for me.\n\nEventually I worked up the courage to ask her to date me and she agreed, much to my surprise. Much of the school didn’t approve of our relationship due to manifestations of elitist culture and how judgmental people can be when it comes to appearances. I thought I was going to live out my life happy with her much like in those Korean dramas I’ve always considered silly.\n\nMy dreams of an ideal romance was shattered when I was diagnosed with a terminal disease. At the time of diagnosis I had four months left, now most of that time has passed as I’ve attempted to continue a life of normalcy with increasing failing attempts at covering my poor health. My cough no longer passable as a cold, my limp no longer concealable as a sore leg, I can no longer maintain the pretense that everything is alright. \n\nAs I realized how much pain she would’ve been in had I passed away, I ended my relationship with her abruptly, without explanation. She was hurt, as to be expected, but I reasoned she’d be better off without the burden of my death on her. If nothing else, she deserves better than me as I cannot be there for her much longer. \n\nNow at the end of my life, I’m coming to reflect on all the things I wish I could’ve done differently, as many others have done before me. Yet, I find little I would’ve changed because now that I’m in the ninth inning, as my username suggests, I’ve arrived at the realization life is simply a set of cards dealt by the universe in which there is no order. The universe is neither good nor bad, it’s apathetic and uncaring. Nearing the end, I’ll die alone as my mother is now preoccupied with raising my brother to replace me an ocean away. I don’t mind it, as my parents have never truly been together with me. \n\nWith death imminent, I’ve considered professing my belief in a higher power but that would be a lie. Never in my life have I believed in the existence of a supreme being who is responsible for life. I shall die as I’ve lived, by myself, save for a short amount of time that I’ve been lucky enough to spend with her. \n\nIf you’ve read to this point I would like to say thank you, and I’ll miss you, even if I’ve never met you before. Maybe I’ll be proven wrong and there is something greater than us out there. In that case I’ll look forward to seeing her again, someday. \n\nThank you and farewell\n-Anonymous",

I would’ve taken a bullet, ran through IED infested fields, died for my brothers, got COVID, worked back to back 10 hour shifts because everyone else quit, the fucking list goes on. My urgent care department and ICU are entirely full of unvaccinated fucking morons right now. They’re fucking up everything for patients who actually need our care and can’t get into the emergency department at our hospital due to them also being swarmed with fuckheads. I’ve never thought this, but after having over 150 patients a day with only three providers and our nurses crying in our lab, I’m over it. I’m tired of so many patients thinking it’s bullshit until they’re sitting on deaths door and beginning for treatment. I’m tired of working 60 hour weeks because we’re so understaffed. \n\nI’ve always felt like this was my calling. I’ve loved patient care and interacting with patients, taking care of them, making sure they felt comfortable and safe, and this last week has truly changed me. \n\nWhen the news broke out about the Omicron variant, I immediately hoped that it was the most lethal yet, and that it just wrecked havoc on the population, and that was such a horrible thing of me to think and I’ve never felt like this. I don’t even care at this point and I want people who are still doubting the severity of this virus to suffer. \n\nEven writing this I feel bad, but part of me is just over it all. I am emotionally dead after struggling so much for the past two years.",

      "body": "She’s only 37. Her birthday is in exactly two weeks.\n\nHappened on Sunday. We made a nice Easter dinner. right in the middle of it she said she felt funny and stopped eating. Then she started to lose feeling on her left side. I called 911 and she was taken to a hospital.\n\nI couldn’t see her because of viral precautions. So I sat in a waiting room for hours to speak to a doctor.  \n\nShe had emergency surgery. Part of her skull was removed to relieve pressure and they took out a most of the blood from a “massive hemorage” that was pressing against her brain stem.  \n\nShe’s stable but in a stupor state. She responds to pain only in her right arm, but then goes back to unresponsive. \n\nI can’t visit her while she’s in the ICU, again because of viral precautions. So I’m at home getting periodic calls from nurses and doctors.\n\nI don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I’m just crying and wanting to scream \n\nI don’t have much of a support network. My parents died when I was a teen. we don’t have many friends just one person we’re close to\n\nOn my wife’s side her mom was killed 9 years ago during a burglary. And she’s not on the best terms with her father. But I’ve still been keeping him updated\n\ntyping this all sounds fake. So much crap we’ve had to deal with and now this\n\nWe have two dogs and they were barking most of the day. I break down in tears again telling them she can’t hear them right now\n\nAnd something small and silly, but makes me extra sad is we had just finished laundry so nothing smells like her. \n\nThanks if anyone reads this. I just want to rant, and not feel so completely alone. And want people to know how much I love her.\n\n*edit 1 I’ll try and comment to people directly but I want everyone to know that this helped more then you might think. Reading strangers who don’t have to care be nice is really comforting and I was able to sleep most of the night.\nI haven’t gotten any updates over night so I hope that means at least she’s the same.\n\n*edit 2 just talked to the ICU nurse and she's about the same. her eyes are reacting now but she'll go back to unresponsive without direct stimulus. no responding to commands.\n\n*edit 3. 2pm. Nothing to update Yet for those asking. I’m just very glad I bought a dozen handkerchiefs for allergy season.  That’s cutting down on the tissue use a lot especially with how hard it is to find paper products right now\n\n*edit the 4th. 11:30 PM. She’s still doing the same. It’s just a waiting game to see if she improves.  Right now I’m keeping busy taking care of all the animals. I mentioned the two dogs, One corgi and one pomeranian, we also have two cats. They’re both persians that are ex show cats. We got them from a lady that rescue show cats after they can’t compete anymore. But she’s over 60 now and can’t handle the dozen or so she had.  They’re a lot of work \n\n*Edit 5 weds morning: She’s off blood pressure meds, she’s moving her right arm a lot. Her left arm is showing some reactions but it’s minimal. Left leg still shows no reactions. back to waiting and hoping\n\n*Edit 6 weds night: She’s opening her eyes some but not really following movement. She’s been acting agitated so she’s been put on some pain medication.  the rest is about the same. still “trending positive” is the phrase they used\n\n*Edit 7 Thursday morning. Neurological she’s the same. She’s still on pain meds and intubated on a CPAP and a feeding tube in her nose. \n\tI can tell they’re gently telling me that this might take a very long time, they’re talking about more long term solutions like a tracheotomy for breathing and a PEG tube for feeding. If she doesn’t show much progress 7-10 days after the event.  So this coming Sunday to next Wednesday.  \n\n*Edit 8 Thursday night. Still the same again. The nurse tonight mentioned that her blood pressure seems to spike after being touched. So that’s a reaction of sort. Happened before this too, she was really only touchy with me. And even then in a bad mood she wanted to be left alone. I asked about FaceTime again and apparently they’re doing “Virtual Visits” so they’re going to try and set that up for tomorrow.\n\n*Edit 9. Friday morning. Had my virtual visit. Just told her all the things the pets have been doing IE one of the cats went on a puke fest last night. The best part was just watching her breathe, it was the same as how she sleeps.\n\n*Edit 10. No changes to her condition to update. I had to give our Persians a bath today. That was not fun to do without her.\n\n*Edit 11 No changes to her state of consciousness. I had another virtual visit, I got her dad join. But the connection was so terrible we had to constantly reconnect to get google hangouts working again. Just let her know that I gave the unopened milk away to a family across the street. I also helped an older lady bring her groceries into her house. She said her Husband had passed away last summer, heart attack and then stroke. Small world\n\n*Edit 12 Saturday night. She’s still the same they have her on an EEG machine overnight checking in case she’s having small seizures maybe it can say if anyone is still home.\n\n*Edit 13 Sunday morning. No improvements. I’ll be a week come 7pm tonight. I got a small prognosis and it isn’t a good one. I don’t even want to type it out. I have rough week ahead. Still hoping for that miracle\n\n*Edit 14 Sunday night. No changes to update. A week ago she was just getting out of emergency surgery at this time and I was sitting in the waiting room at the hospital. Everything feels so unreal now. I need a miracle hon, please\n\n*Edit 15. Monday. No change in conditions. The current prognosis is she’ll be like this for possibly years. Maybe after a time being able to open her eyes and upgrading to a “Vegetative” state. She’ll never come back to who she was. \n\n*Edit 16 Tuesday. No changes, she’s plateaued. I started talking to a social worker at the hospital. I’m still doing the virtual visits once a day. \n\n*Edit 17 Wednesday. She had an MRI for a clearer picture of her brain. The EEG was showing she might be deteriorating. There’s a big chunk of her brain that isn’t getting any oxygen. Acute ischemia to a few Latin named parts: the corpus callosum, basal inula, etc. So a chunk of her brain is damaged and the brain doesn’t grow back. She’s on a limited DNR right now in case something else happens it’ll be between her and the universe.\n\n*Edit 18. Thursday. She’s being moved into hospice. She has too much brain damage and will never wake up and always be on life support. I could keep her going for months, but that would be against her wishes given well before all this. I’ll get to visit her tomorrow though. \n\n*Edit 19. She’s just passed on. \n\n*Edit 20. I'm alive. thanks for people sending me messages and chats. my world has shattered completely. whenever she got really depressed and suicidal she'd say \"But I want to say with you\" I'm sorry honey you won't be able to do that.\n\n*Edit 21. May the 4th. Been 3 weeks since her stroke and over one since she passed. I’m still surviving. I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing or what I’m supposed to be doing. Just thought I’d update since people are still following this and giving their condolences.  Thanks",

      "body": "I work at a large sortable fulfillment center owned by Amazon.  I'm not going to go off on Amazon's work rules in this post.  They are demanding, but offer good pay for unskilled labor and have excellent benefits.  The job is way below my education and experience level, but I took the job knowing full well that it would be demanding.\n\nIt's the inventory and volume of inventory that causes me to lose hope for humanity.  Our facility is almost 1 million square feet, and it's stuffed to the gills with shit people don't need.  The sheer number of gadgets, gizmos, trinkets, decorations and toys contained in this warehouse is mind-boggling.  The number of sex toys alone is staggering.\n\nEach and every day, an average of 70 semi trailers packed full of useless items back into our dock where product is offloaded.  Since the inventory levels remain fairly constant, a similar volume of shipments are made to customers daily as well.\n\nAmazon has approximately 175 fulfillment centers, so simple math says the inbound/outbound volume of this crap is somewhere around 4.5 million truckloads a year... and growing!  That may be off to a degree, but is directionally correct.\n\nEach of those inbound shipments comes to us in a corrugated box.  Most of the time it's a box within a box.  Frequently it's in a box that's in a box that's in a box.  That's a crap-ton of corrugated cardboard boxes.\n\nAnd then there's the outbound boxes...\n\nVirtually all of the products are enclosed in some sort of plastic, be it a poly sleeve, a plastic clamshell or some other sort of manufactured packaging.  I can't begin to estimate how much petroleum is needed to make all this plastic packaging.  This doesn't even include the fuel used to transport product from raw materials to finished goods to China port to USA port to distribution centers to fulfillment centers and finally to Betty Sue and Bob.\n\nMy guess is 80%+ of this stuff is manufactured in China or a neighboring ASEAN market.  There have to be hundreds of millions of people employed at finished goods factories in China producing these goods.  Add to that all the people involved with inland / ocean freight and customer deliveries.\n\nAnd then there's Walmart, Target, maybe 100 other big box retailers and a slew of smaller venues who sell these items.  Amazon isn't the only game in town.\n\nMy guess is that of the 7.8 billion people on this planet, that at least 25% are involved somehow in this distribution machine.\n\nSimple math again says that 2+ billion people make their livelihoods in some form, shape or fashion serving Amazon and its competitors.\n\nAnd then there's the customers...\n\nSo this is what the meaning of life has come down to.  A significant portion of the world's human resources have life occupations producing, selling and delivering products that nobody really needs.  At the same time, the sheer volume of consumption of resources to feed this beast blow my mind.  \n\nAnd the consumers can't get enough of it.\n\nIt's simply depressing.  That is all!",

      "title": "My wife is not the woman I used to know. She let the fame get to her.",
      "body": "I know I won't probably get anything meaningful from reddit, but at this stage of life I don't have a single soul to talk to.\n\nI met my wife when I was 15 in high school, she was 17. That latter part of my teenage years was probably the hardest of my life, since in half a year I lost my mother. Never knew my dad so she was the only thing I could consider \"family\".\n\nAt that time, me and my wife were only friends, but she was there for me, and grieved with me. I think I started developing feelings for her during that time.\n\nWe started dating when I was 17, and we got married 7 years later.\n\nFor context, my wife was very frugal and unmaterialstic. She never cared about clothes, makeup, brands, cars, ect.. Always spending money on thrift shops or during sales on whatever she liked. I remember trying to impress her with my 370z just for her to react with \"what car is this? A Corolla?\" So yeah. I think you get the type. But that's what I liked about her the most. And also, she was the most caring person I ever knew.\n\nIn our family, she's the successful one, always working in big corporations. Regarding myself, I always worked as a community first responder for my local hospital. The salary wasn't high, but I loved my job, helping people as I could.\n\nFast forward, two years ago she received an offer from an important company for an executive position, offering four (yes, four) times her salary (and let me tell you, her salary wasn't bad by any means). But we should've to move to a different city. At first, I was doubtful, since that would've mean losing my job and not be sure if I could have contributed financially to our family for an indefinite time period, but she said that she could have sustained the family effortlessly with this new job, and for that time I could have looked after the house and groceries, till I could've found a new job. Since she was so enthusiastic, I accepted. I was happy to support my wife's carrier.\n\nWell, the best way I can put it is that my wife underwent a crazy trasformation. Some Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide type thing, if you know what I mean. She started caring more and more about luxury brands, jewels, cars, etc. I don't think you can quite imagine my disbelief seeing her coming back home with a Versace bag after seeing her for years wearing 10$ coats from our local trift shop.\n\nShe also started hanging out with her new female coworkers a lot. My wife isn't very extroverted or very social, so that was quite the shock, but I was very very happy for her. I thought that she finally found her dimension after years of struggling.\n\nBut that happiness started fading after she started coming way later and home every day. And later. And later. Until it was a miracle to be able to talk to her for 10 minutes a day. I thought it was very busy with work (since well being an executive means lots of work), till she started posting lots of photos of her with her coworkers drinking, going shopping and stuff. The fun part is, she never finds time to reply to my text, but she always has a minute to post photos. And when she replies, she says that she's \"working\".\n\nShe also literally stopped saying things to me altogheter. Have you ever experienced your wife/husband going to work with an Audi A3 and then coming back home with a Porsche Macan GTS? Well, I did, and let me tell you. It's no fun. I confronted her on if it was a business issued car, which it isn't, then on why she spent so much money on a car when she didn't care not even a little about cars. Her passive aggressive response was that it's her money and that she entitled to do as she pleases.\n\nOr have you experienced not seeing your wife/husband coming back home for a night and not replying to text just to receive a call the following afternoon saying that she forgot telling me that she left for a business trip? Well. I hope you haven't.\n\nBut the worse is when she invited me for lunch with her coworkers. I was very happy because that was the first time we were doing something together in months, and I thought that what I've experienced before what only a phase and that it was all ended.\n\nMy wife left first because she had work to do, so I dressed up nicely and left two hours after to the scheduled restaurant.\n\nFor context, I sold years before my 370z because I didn't need a sportscar no more, so my daily driver is a very frugal Renault Clio. I like it, and since I don't need that much, I don't have reasons to upgrade to a pricer model or brand. Well, I get to the restaurant, park my car in front of it, get inside just to see my wife staring at me like horror stricken. She gets up from the table and takes me outside of the restaurant, then proceed to literally insult me for parking my Clio in front of the restaurant and in front of her table, saying that I embarrassed her and that I should've parked it somewhere hidden. I was completely at a loss for words. I asked her why, and she said that it was a cheap, non luxury car, not representative of her lifestyle. She then gets back inside the restaurant, warning me not to embarass her like this again. I attended the rest of the lunch in shock. That day I realized that that girl I had at my side wasn't my wife. It wasn't the girl I married anymore.\n\nMy wife is now out of the house, celebrating a great year for the company, and I'm here at home writing this with the divorce papers in front of me. I don't think I can handle this situation anymore. I tried lots and lots of time to talk to her, to tell her how I feel, to tell her that she changed, that she's not the same woman I knew. But she just doesn't listen. She always says that she has no time and that she needs to work, or she tries to minimize the situation saying that it's not true and that she never changed.\n\nShe wanted kids, now she doesn't want them anymore, saying that they would rob her time from her carreer. She wanted to travel, now she doesn't want to do it, for the same reason. Is she really the same woman I married?\n\nBut still, I can't bring myself to talk about divorce with her. Most likely because I hope that somewhere hidden inside of her there's still the woman I loved and still love. Even if this doesn't seems like the case.",

I had a whole speech prepared to confront him with, but I could only end up saying \"i know about you and Karo\"  \nI'll spare the details of the conversation because it's still raw, but he left around midnight. He only took a few of his things. I haven't spoken to him since, aside from him telling me he was coming to get more of his things, and after our conversation I've decided to go through with divorce. I've collected all the necessary information, and I'll be getting in touch with a lawyer shortly.   \nAgain, Thank you all for the advice and help to come to my senses.",

      "body": "No one gives you awards for taking a shower. But for me it was like climbing a god damn mountain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost a full year ago, I was raped and left bleeding outside a BDSM club in San Francisco. I was a sophomore in college, a band kid, an amazing job, and had a good life set for me on the west coast. Until this happened.\n\nI thought I had gotten my period the next morning- I would find out it was actually tears and open cuts inside me when I decided to go to the hospital. My chest was bruised so badly the mark didn't go away for almost 2 months. I had been badly hurt, and was put on anti-HIV pills. My mom flew from across the country to stay with me. After a few days, it was decided that I would move back home to heal, and reconsider school in the spring.\n\nI was quiet, I slept until 3 in the afternoon, and my nightmares were horrible but the medication for the nightmares made me suicidal. Most of all, I **hated** my body. I would wear the same outfit 3 days in a row to avoid changing, or change in the dark. The first time I washed my hair was in January, in the sink, crying in the Adult Psych unit. The nurses washed my hair with buckets over the sink and I felt like I was drowning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wash my body under my clothes with bath wipes, a product meant for the elderly. I manage to wash my hair once a week, or I aim for once a week. The shower is scary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yesterday I did it. I stood half-in, and let the water hit my back, and the top of my head, and it felt like acid at first but I stayed in there for a minute and a half. I covered myself fully in the towel and put my back against the mirror. I put clothes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I finally fucking showered.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I do it again? I don't know, because the day it happened is coming up and I can already feel myself sinking down into the anxiety, the fear, and the depression of my PTSD. I climbed up one mountain but there's an entire range I have to get through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow, I am blown away by everyone's kindness. I understand rip inbox now. And thank you, anonymous stranger, for the gold. I've been trying to talk more often about what happened, because if it stays in my head I go mad about it, and my PTSD goes into bad places. And as a woman, I need to tell my story, or the rapists win. I just started therapy again, which I'm fearing but going into with my head up. There is.....so much I want to say but It's near midnight. I hope to respond to as many people as I can in the morning :)\n\n\nEDIT 2 (Nov 26 2018) : I am blown away by your support, reddit. I still receive PMs and they help me through the days when its even harder to get up and live. I have been able to shower three times since, thanks to Float Therapy. I cannot believe how amazing it is- and how much it has helped with regular therapy. I go every other week due to the cost but when I go I can shower afterwards for some reason? My guess is that the sensory deprivation in the floating chamber helps separate me from my mind and my body and I can allow myself to feel nice things, like warm water and lemongrass soap. Happy holidays, heres to recovery for all <3\n\n\nEdit: June 25th, 2019: This post is still going around....I get a few messages every few weeks. It’s a weird feeling, that people still read it and that people I don’t know believe in me. On good days I feel great, but on bad days I feel like I’m letting strangers down....\n\nI am trying to get into a residential program right now. It’s out of state and there are many man hoops to jump through with insurance. But it’s one step closer to getting better. I found tattoos to be healing, but it’s hard to save up when living on SSI. \n\nAs for me...things have gotten worse in many ways, but they’ve also gotten better. I’m back to showering out of a bucket and the sink. I still feel as if my body is some strange creature. But I wake up every morning. There isn’t that immediate fear whenever I hear a door open. I have less nightmares. I collect Furbys. I am trying to build a life outside of my trauma- I joined a band, I saw a new primary care doctor, I even started saving for a trip to the Netherlands in May...\n\nI started living. I guess I figured out how to move on.",

      "body": "Six months ago, I left this comment on askreddit with the promise that I would update the story eventually.\n\n\n*I made a throwaway for this question.*\n\n*We were at a work party, I was in college and she was a career waitress.*\n\n*I had recently gotten out of a long term relationship that just fucking destroyed me, I wanted nothing, no sex, no hook ups, no cuddling in bed, I just wanted to be alone. I picked up the job at the restaurant to keep myself busy and make some extra money. I needed my time occupied, and this was the best way at the time.*\n\n*She had came on to me at work, but I kindly turned her down, telling her that i was not ready for any kind of relationship. She flirted often, but I didn’t reciprocate. I literally had zero interest, in anyone.*\n\n*I had 2 drinks at the party, and then one at a coworkers house after work shut their party down. I blacked out (not at all like me), woke up around sunrise half naked with her snuggled up to me. We had definitely had sex, no fucking condom in sight. I was confused, very very confused. Not happy. Not even a little bit.*\n\n*I slithered our from under her and got dressed, I walked a few miles home and passed out for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work that day.*\n\n*I went in the next day and told them what had happened, i got a write up for missing my shift and made fun of for complaining about getting laid. I walked out and never went back.*\n\n*15 years later, I found out she had had a baby. We are in the process of finding out if it’s mine. This shit consumes my thoughts every goddamn day now. I have no idea what we are going to do if he is mine.*\n\n*Edit: this is all fresh, she wants back money. Very very much about the money, I don’t know why but she thinks that we’re loaded or something. We are not by any means. Life has been one expensive disaster after another for my entire adulthood. This is my wife’s insulin she dropped today while shaking about what the fuck we are going to do. Everything is a mess.*\n\n*I’ll update this story minus identifying details on this profile if you want to follow. Maybe it will be cathartic for me.*\n\nAs it turns out, the child was mine. We were hit with a massive child support amount to provide and were thinking that things were going to be ok in a few years after we caught it up. Right up until the pandemic hit and we both lost our jobs. Everything slipped, all the bills piled up. It was ok though, we still had food on the table and were hopeful to return to work. \n\nWe still haven’t returned since March. We were nearly out of money when today I went to get a few groceries and my card was declined. I was embarrassed, but thought that surely there was a mistake. Nope, the state seized the tiny bit of money we had left.  No way to buy food, no way to buy my wife’s insulin or supplies. Just a big pile of hopelessness. \n\nI’m sitting in my car and I have no idea how to go inside to tell my wife just how screwed we are. \n\nYou can do everything you’re supposed to, and still wind up at the bottom. \n\nI wish my family didn’t suffer from my unfortunate past.\n\nEdit: a redditor is shipping us a months supply of insulin. I cannot begin to tell you how grateful we are to this community and the people that make it up.\n\nThe outpouring of support is overwhelming. We put our kids to bed and are sitting here reading all these kind words. It’s a lot. Thank you all.",

I am tired of hearing the same cliche answers \"you are still young\", \"you will change your mind\", \"I used to say the same thing, but now I am happy with kids\", \"your man will get tired of you without kids\", \"women are programmed to be mothers\".\n\nWell fuck you, how about that? This is not an issue I want debated, this is not an issue I want your fucking opinion. If I regret it, it's my problem not yours. If my man gets tired of me, again it's my problem not yours. How hard is it to understand that some women do not dream of becoming mothers? That some people feel already complete without a kid? Stop trying to be an wiseass and think you know my wishes and dreams better than me. I find it perfectly ok for a woman to want to become a mother, but as well not to become.\n\nIf a woman says \"I don't want kids\", or anything similar, or expresses in a vague way the kid plan isn't her thing, just shut up. Some women don't want and some cannot become mothers. Eitherway it is not your business and your conversation to open.\n\nEDIT: Wow, didn't expect this post to blow up like this. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply, to agree, to disagree. Especially thanks to everyone that shared their personal experiences and stories of not wanting or not being able to have kids. Thanks also to the fellow redditors that gave this post the award. \n\nAs for some comments I read, I wanna say the following:\n\n- Never said or implied that the dialogue above come only from men. Actually the majority of comments I hear come from women. So do not make it a \"when a woman says something, everyone else must shut up\". This post is not for attacking men.\n\n- Every social/political phenomenon affects both women and men and that is a fact. But it is important for all of us to understand the target group that affects more. I am sure there are many guys out there that either do not want or cannot have children. But I highly doubt men are seen as baby machines that must have kids before the 'good years' pass, or have heard the things women have, or have been judged as much for not wanting/having kids.",

      "body": "I'm average looking at best. Many even find me ugly. It is what it is. I can't say that I'm \"over\" the fact that people find me ugly because being physically unattractive has gotten me rude comments about my appearance for most of my life. And I know it's not just people being mean. When I'm out with my attractive friends, I notice how people treat them very differently (in a positive way). It's a level of privilege that I'll never experience, which sucks, but it's certainly not my friends' faults. \n\nWhere I *do* get upset is when people feel the need to comment on how \"lucky\" I am. My husband is often jokingly called the third Hemsworth brother. He's a good looking dude. I don't disagree with that fact at all. When people meet my husband for the first time I *always* get comments. \"You're so *lucky* you managed to get a guy like him.\" or \"That's *your* husband?\" or \"Oh, you've been together since high school. *Now* it makes sense.\" Like, wtf?\n\nSome of these comments could definitely be innocent enough except for two things. First, their stress on certain words that clearly imply that they think he's way out of my league. Secondly, it's never ever the other way around. People never make comments like that to my husband about how \"lucky\" he is for snagging me. \n\nThe worst time was one day a few years ago when I was waiting tables to pay my way through college. I had been working at the restaurant for over a year at that point. My husband came in by himself and sat in my section, so we could sort of \"hang out\" (we both had really busy schedules back then, so we weren't able to spend much time together). Several of my female coworkers (and even some of my gay male coworkers) kept pointing out the \"hot guy who looks like Liam Hemsworth\" sitting at table such-and-such. They kept telling each other about him and encouraging each other to walk by his table to \"go check him out.\" It was kind of funny at first, until I told one of them that he was my husband. \"He's *your* husband?\" the coworker asked incredulously. Next thing I know, I'm overhearing my coworkers say shit like, \"Yeah, that's apparently *cnyrxx's* husband. Like, how and the hell did she manage that?\" and other similar things when I'm walking by them to get to the kitchen/my tables. I felt like crying before the day was over.\n\nI wanted to get this off my chest because I just got another comment like this today. I don't know if it's because I'm feeling particularly insecure today since I'm about to start my period, but jesus christ. I'm a fucking worthwhile person, too, and there are things about me that make my husband fucking lucky to have \"caught\" me, too (to which he whole-heartedly agrees, but I digress). \n\nI'm just sick of it. And I'm sick of being made to feel like I have no value as a human being because I am not physically attractive. \n\nPeople suck.",

I’d get things like “but you’re pretty regardless!” And that was such a weird feeling of “oh good, I’m glad I’m not ugly?” Mixed with “oh wow, there’s something really bad about me”. I was fat, but I knew myself, I was (mostly) comfortable, I was generally happy, I was sure of myself. \n\nThen, I lost 100 pounds. I weigh between 115-120 now. What gets me is how differently I’m treated. \n\nAfter 70 pounds lost, in one month I had gotten hit on more times that I’ve probably even interacted with a man in my life. I thought it was a fluke. At my job today, a guy came in who I recognized has been coming to our town for the past couple years on vacation. Incredibly cute, really nice and personable. When he used to come in, he didn’t really look at me twice, and I would think “if only I was skinny, I might be worth looking at”. \n\nWell, today... today he looked. I could tell he didn’t even recognize me (not that I’d expect him to, weight loss or not) but then after he left, he came back an hour later to ask me out on a date. This should have made me happy. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been tongue tied around this guy. I should have been excited. Instead, I felt nothing and politely declined. It was only after, as I was sitting at my desk, that I got incredibly sad. I became sad about how much your appearance can affect how people see you. \n\nI became sad because the irony is... me now, the one he actually noticed? The absolute mess with depression, body dysmorphia, a horrible relationship with herself and food, irritable all the time, no longer enjoys life? I doubt that’s someone he’d actually want to take out. But... that other girl? The old me, who was overweight, confident, vibrant, sure of herself, happy, enjoyed life and everything it had to offer, kind to herself and others? \n\nHe probably would have really liked her.",

I’m pretty terrified to begin working as a whole-ass real nurse, but I’m excited to begin a brand new chapter of my post-heroin life. I feel like I’m becoming a “real” person.

When I went to rehab 3.5 years ago, I wrote in my journal that I would never stay clean. That it wasn’t going to work. I was only going because my life had fallen apart and my family was desperate. But life has a funny way of showing you how dumb you are, and now it’s been 3 years and I can’t imagine going back to that life. Never again.\n\nI hope in my new career, I’ll be able to help some people. I hurt a lot of people in my addiction that I cared deeply about. Nothing will change the past, but I want my future to be one where people remember me for having brought some light into their life, instead of just darkness. \n\nAnyhoot it’s just been a wild ride to this point and I wanted to share with the vast and empty void of the internet.

He has a few little hidey holes for important stuff, he’s like WALL-E, so I went to his bedside table, bottom drawer, where he occasionally keeps old financial stuff. \n\nAnd there it was, just staring at me. I had no idea. \n\nEvery card I’ve ever given him, every cutesy love letter, every sappy post-it. Stacked neatly in the back corner. Some in envelopes, some out. Over six inches high. Every card I fretted over, every page of handwritten 3AM hopes and dreams. I’m a writer, so words are important to me and they are the way I express myself when it’s difficult to do so verbally. He knows this. \n\nPeople always say it’s so nice to see how happy we are. That we’re “that couple”. I feel it. It’s not like we never left the honeymoon phase. We had some issues for a while, most people don’t know, but we pushed through and we’re both better partners because of it. I never thought I could be this happy. In a million years, I never would have dreamed that I could have this kind of loving, challenging, supportive, affectionate, sexy, silly, perfectly complimentary relationship. I feel lucky every day to have found this wonderful man and I will never, ever take it for granted. \n\nBut seeing that stack of cards, even though it may seem small to some in the grand scheme of things, just really made me happy today. I told him I loved him for the first time in a rambling valentine’s day card, 7 1/2 years ago. We make a special point on every birthday, anniversary, whatever, to get the other person a nice card, write a little something. \n\nMaybe one day he’ll be looking for something and find my stash, tucked away in my bookshelf: a stack of every card he’s ever given me.\n\nEdit: I think it’s very “Reddit” that everyone’s initial expectations went in such different directions - candy to fake money to guns to a variety of drugs to hentai. We truly do live in a society. Thanks for all the love - I don’t have writing up anywhere else currently, for anyone that asked, but I’m considering posting now, hah.",

      "title": "UPDATE IV: I think my husband fathered his best friend's children, and now one of them is attracted to my daughter.",
      "body": "In my last post, there were a number of criticisms toward Paige. (You guys will like this update as it turns out, you weren’t the only ones who had a problem with her.) \n\nAs far as the deed being in my name, it’s not an absolute hook, line, and sinker, but Paige is convinced that between that and my having been the one paying the mortgage, I stand a very good chance. It could be interpreted as a common marital property, but I’m going for primary custody with supervised visits anyway. I’m playing hardball. People also questioned whether I should still be posting these, but so long as it’s all anonymous, I am in the clear. Doesn't even matter if someone who knows me could figure out I posted this. I didn’t use any real names, or reveal my location, or anything like that. As for the laptop, even Paige admitted that was questionable, but technically I gave permission and she was only doing what I could have easily done on my own. I just really didn’t want to go through all of that content. As far as the divorce papers, Paige had them filled out after the very first time I contacted her. My ‘serving’ them to Luke was ceremonial, she still contacted him later to “officially” serve him and request his lawyer’s details. \n\nBut before he could respond, I had already done something a little sneaky. I reached out to our “family” attorney, the one who has always been on call to represent me and Luke during our marriage. (He helped us out of a jam with the HOA a while back.) I’ll call him “Zack.” Now, contrary to some of the comments’ suggestions, I cannot just go around town consulting with every lawyer in the area, with the explicit purpose of locking my husband out of hiring them. That is bad faith and judges don’t look too kindly on it. However, this was Zack. He had been \\*my\\* attorney (and Luke’s) for years. I feel like I had just as much right to him as Luke did. And I got there first. So I was able to nail down our family’s lawyer. Met with both him and Paige, and boy howdy, do they not like each other. Zach brought up some of the same problems as some of my comments. He argued that Paige’s activity was in the “gray” area and urged me to hire him to represent me in the divorce instead. That caused a bit of conflict as Paige is explicitly a “family” attorney and this is her specialization. So I’m going to be consulting both of them from here on out. Zach actually thinks it’s a good thing that I made these posts as they can’t really do much other than prove my sanity when Luke and Amy try to argue otherwise. \n\nOverall, I am doing better. I’ve been talking to a friend in real life, the mom of one of Sophie’s friends. I also have therapy scheduled for myself, and I intend to look into family therapy as well. When my kids ask me what’s going on, I simply tell them that their father and I are having adult problems and it’s nothing they need to worry about. That worked for about a day. Sophie warned me they were planning to confront me as a group, and they did, asking if Dad had cheated on me with Amy. Obviously, they’ve been talking about this, and perhaps they have been for longer than I had anticipated. Perhaps they’ve been wondering. Again, even though I had absolute proof, I was hesitant to tell them as much, and let me explain why. I naturally wouldn’t tell them about the pornographic content I found, I would simply say that I found messages between Luke and Amy revealing their affair. But, with the exception of Sophie, they wouldn’t be satisfied with that. I already know Carter, curious little sweetheart that he is, would want to see these messages. So instead, when I was asked directly by my kids if their Dad had cheated on me, I simply said “I believe he did, yes.” With as much sincerity as I could muster. I think they believe me. Tom and Sophie are texting nonstop, and from what I can gather, there’s doubt among Amy’s children as well, that this is about me “losing my mind” and not about their mother being too close to my husband. \n\nI think it’s slowly sinking in for poor Jim that what he didn’t want to believe was possible is very much possible, and it’s happening. I haven’t shown him or Cat any letters or anything. They’re hosting Luke, so I haven’t had much of any contact with them at all. But I did have one phone call with Cat where we wished each other well, that was nice. In the background, I could hear shouting and though Cat quickly went outside, I did hear what sounded like Jim shouting at Luke. He doesn’t usually shout, he’s the calmest man I’ve ever met, so in a way I’m worried about him but also relieved that the wool is being pulled off of his eyes. According to Cat, Luke is still staunchly denying everything. He was pretty upset when he found out that I had poached Zach, though. Which gave me a kind of grim satisfaction. \n\nThe test results came back! Sophie and Tom tested their DNA against each other to see if they truly are blood siblings. Here’s a surprise - according to the test, they’re not. They don’t share any DNA. To everyone who believed Jim had fathered Amy’s babies, here is definitive proof that he did not, because the test would have revealed that too. But I never believed it anyway. Sophie has her doubts and wonders if the results weren’t faulty and if we shouldn’t take another test to be absolutely certain, but I’m not really worried about that. More confused than anything. I was so certain Tom had to be Luke’s son. He was too. Now he doesn’t know what to think and I don’t either. I obviously now know the affair happened and lasted years, and I know from the letters that Kaylee is Luke’s child, or at least both he and Amy seem to believe she is, which confirms they were intimate fifteen years ago. Now I’m just wondering for Tom’s sake. Who, if not Luke, is his father? He does kind of look like Luke, but that might just be coincidence. \n\n**In general, everything was quiet for a few days, until it wasn’t. Until she finally showed her face. My “best friend” Amy.** \n\nI am so happy I installed ring cameras everywhere as you are about to understand. Sure enough, Amy turned up on my doorstep and asked to talk. She had a relaxed demeanor and did not raise her voice. Assuming she was approaching me on Luke’s behalf, I told her that I wasn’t interested in talking to her and to just go away. She did not leave, but she didn’t make a scene either. She persisted in telling me we needed to have a conversation. The kids weren’t home, and did have cameras inside - I was also recording her on my phone and being discreet about it - so eventually I relented and let her in. I don’t know if she realized she was on camera. We sat down on the couch, and she instantly got into the reason for her visit. Turns out, she and Luke know (or suspect) that I procured damning material from his laptop. Amy accused me of going through his devices and told me that anything I found was not my business and I needed to delete it. That was all she had to say. No apology, no admission of guilt, didn’t take responsibility for her own behavior. Hell, she might have known I was recording her, because she didn’t even directly acknowledge what the “sensitive material” on Luke’s laptop actually *was.* \n\nSo I confronted her, letting out some of my anger. I asked how she could have the nerve to make demands of me. I asked her why she and Luke would do a thing like this in the first place. Why had they seen fit to spend all these years betraying me? I posed the question that I’d been wondering about for a long time, and as I expected, I got no answer. Literally, Amy didn’t seem to really hear me even as I confronted her. She seemed like she was stressed. Panicked, even. But she was keeping it under wraps. She ignored my questions and accusations, and just kept telling me to delete whatever content from Luke’s laptop that I had. She said that if I wanted to divorce Luke, that was my call, but not to “drag her into it.” Oh, that made me so mad. I kept my temper, but I did snap back that she was already very much in it. Amy just kept repeating herself. Telling me to delete whatever I found. So I just refused. I asked her, point blank, why I should. Why did I have any reason to? \n\nAmy got more aggressive, raising her voice. She was trying to intimidate me but I held my ground. She told me that this wasn’t about me, and that I needed to just do as she said. That it was very important. So, I asked again: Why? And yet again, she would not answer. So I asked her if Luke had sent her to do this or if she had shown up on her own. No answer to that either. It was like talking to a brick wall. So I asked her to leave. Just as I’d been afraid of, she wouldn’t go. She refused to leave until I had deleted everything I’d found “in front of her.” I couldn’t help laughing. I told her no, that wasn’t going to happen. This is where I could see her starting to freak out more. In another moment, she got up, ran into the other room, and grabbed my laptop. Before I could stop her, she smashed it on the floor. I really don’t know why she thought that would work or get her the outcome she wanted, I think she was just panicking. Obviously, I still have everything (except now I need to buy a new laptop..) and, sadly, her doing this was out of frame of the camera, but it’s fine. All of my important files are backed up, and at that moment, I was more concerned that Amy would do something else drastic. She looked like she was going to have a breakdown. I tried again, very calmly, to tell her that she needed to leave or I would call the police. She refused *again,* and just kept repeating her demand that I drop this whole “cheating” angle and divorce Luke without trying to argue that an affair took place. \n\nAt that point I just stared at her. At the woman I had considered one of my dearest friends in all the world. And I told her that I didn’t owe her anything, but she owed her children the truth. That they had the right to know where they came from. Who Luke really was to them. Amy bristled and told me it was none of my business - that I didn’t understand her family and I needed to back off. She kept going back to this idea that I could divorce Luke, but I must not claim he’d had an affair with her. I just told her that I didn’t need her permission to handle my divorce how I wanted, and told her again to leave. She got more and more desperate, and her anger accelerated to the point that she physically attacked me. I did not expect her to actually do this. I’m not much of a fighter but I do know the human body pretty well, and where it’s weakest. She hurt me pretty badly, but I got her off me. That part was very much *on* camera, and the whole audio was recorded on my phone. \n\nShe finally left after that, and I immediately called to file a police report. I had the strangest feeling she’d try something similar and wanted to beat her to the punch. I was able to clean myself up by the time I had to face my kids, and while I downplayed the story, I did not lie to them about why I had a black eye. I told them, for their own safety, to steer clear of Amy. I also sent the footage to Paige and Zack, as well as pictures of my injured state before I cleaned up. They’ve also printed out the letters that reference Kaylee as Luke’s child. \n\nI really feel like Amy just screwed herself over on all this. I don’t know what her motives were. Was she protecting Luke? Was this his idea? Does she just really not want the world to know she’s a homewrecker, is she covering her own ass? As if people didn’t know already? The more of my social circle I talk to, and inform of the basics, the more people are confessing that they had wondered in the past if Luke wasn’t cheating on me, but didn’t have any concrete proof. I suppose Amy doesn’t want her kids to know who fathered them, which does line up, but…I’m still not sure about Tom. I didn’t ask Amy about him in particular. \n\nI don't know why you guys are so eager for these updates but I don't mind posting them. I've never blogged about my life before, I'd imagine it feels something like this?",

I’m very outgoing, don’t really hold back with emotions and chatty whereas he’s very reserved, not very emotional and introverted but we balance each other out very well.\n\nI knew it was his birthday (it happened yesterday) and he’d told me not to bother with getting anything for his birthday because all of his friends were out of town anyway and he was just gonna order takeaway and watch Netflix. \n\nI still wanted to do something so after work I grabbed a pastry from a bougee bakery we live near and got him a bouquet of tulips.\n\nI gave them to him when I got home and I was honestly expecting him to just say thanks and go back into his room. Instead he had a huge smile on his face, kept taking pictures of the flowers to put into his family group chat and found a vase to put them in. He gave me a really long and tight hug and told me quietly, “Thanks Mango, I needed this”.\n\nTurns out it’s the first time anyone’s ever brought him flowers. He spent the next 5 minutes moving the vase around the apartment trying to find the best spot for them. \n\nI nearly teared up and ended up leaving the room. He gave me a really tight hug before he flew back to his country to visit family this morning.\n\nEdit- Wow did not expect this to blow up! Just to clarify, he doesn’t call me Mango, he just calls me by my real name but for the sake of the post I just got “Mango” from my username.\n\nEdit 2- For the ones who are saying this is a romance happening, there’s no chance as he’s gay.

Then the butterflies in my stomach and the blushing everytime she smiled started hitting me. \n\nI’ve been a full time single dad for 3 years since my ex decided to walk out on our daughter. So dating has never been on my mind. They spent Christmas Eve and Christmas with us which led to them staying all weekend. The girls fell asleep on the couch watching Encanto and it was me and her up for another hour chatting. Had a little bit of wine in me so ofc I blurt out that she looks beautiful right now. Randomly, out of nowhere 😅. In the end we kissed though so looks like it worked out for me.\n\nMy heart was racing so fast, I’m pretty sure my whole face was red as hell because it felt so warm suddenly lol. We were both smiling like total idiots. Before they left earlier she kissed my cheek and man I just wanted to pull her in. It’s my first kiss in years, with someone I feel really connected to. It’s just been a really great weekend. Very very happy 😊",

They held each other so tight. Two steps behind, as I walked up, my soon to be husband was so quick to discreetly grab us both, keeping us close, off to the side to give me a proper embrace. We all hugged, his grip was tight. \nHe finally pulled away, seconds feeling like minutes, looked me in the eyes with a mix of sadness and anxiety and said “how did you know? How did you know I needed you today?” And I just looked him in the eyes and said, I don’t know, but maybe because I needed you too.\n\nThe look in his eyes, filled with love and relief when he saw us, the way he lets us know he is ours, just reassures me that this man is whole heartedly committed to me and us and our future, and I could not be more blessed. \n\nEdit: thank you (almost) all of you for such sweet words!

      "title": "I did it. I just resigned from my career in law enforcement after 15 years, foregoing my retirement so I could get out",
      "body": "Most people close to me think that I’m retiring, and they don’t know that I just have had enough. It was a complete surprise to the Department, and a shock to my family. I just couldn’t do it anymore.\n\nI started my career as a police officer about 15 years ago. I was so excited to help people, and to keep people safe. I worked for a large police department with a great record of community involvement, and with very progressive policies. I felt like it would be a good fit. \n\nI excelled in the profession and after a few years was promoted to Detective. I worked in Major Crimes, investigating violent crimes. I eventually specialized in crimes against children and joined a Federal task force. I’ve gone all over the US investigating child predators and felt satisfaction that I was doing the right thing. I also became certified in training law enforcement in Implicit Bias recognition, and ensuring that everyone was treated fairly. \n\nThe problem started when several years ago, I observed an officer get into an argument with a suspect in handcuffs. It escalated when the suspect said something about the officer’s wife, and the suspect was thrown to the ground. The officer jumped on top of the suspect and began punching him in the face while he was handcuffed. I intervened and stopped the officer, and then reported what happened. I gave a full statement under oath of exactly what happened. Instead of being fired, the officer was allowed to resign, and he wasn’t charged. I knew I did the right thing, but always felt it was mishandled.\n\nFrom there, problems started. The supervisors started nitpicking everything I did. I was denied promotions, despite having an absolutely stellar record. Many other officers refused to work with me since I reported what happened. I was transferred to a position that limited me in using my abilities. And as things arose in the news over the past few years about bad policing, I noticed a change in how the rank and file did their jobs and interacted with the public. There was an overwhelming sense that police weren’t appreciated, and that set up officers for negative interactions because they’d show up just waiting for someone to start filming and calling them pigs, etc. mind you, this rarely happened.  But from the times it did happen, it created an “us vs them” mentality. Morale dropped and the Department I worked for, which never had an issue with recruitment, started being understaffed. This created an issue where those that usually wouldn’t make it in the hiring process would be hired. Then, they’d be pushed through the 18 month training process, and then would end up interacting with the public. This led to more “viral” issues because of “contempt of cop”, and then slowly the Department started losing credibility in the community.\n\nThe final straw for me happened earlier this year. When the Capitol insurrection happened, I was *shocked* at how many apologists there were who defended the actions of the mob there. Politically, if you weren’t conservative you were a cop-hater. Having always been left of center, I’d insert my opinion in conversations based on facts. Then it’d get shut down that I was addicted to the “fake news” of NPR and CNN. I was even reported once for “hurting morale” and was lectured about talking politics, even though everyone else did and my views were different than theirs. \n\nJust after this, there were a couple of police shootings in the news and officers were either fired or charged. I watched the body cam videos that were released, and the decision to charge it fire the officers were completely justified. Everyone else around me tried to shoehorn excuses for the officers, which was directly against all sanctioned training. Then, the Chauvin trial verdict came. Suddenly, from so many decision makers on the Department, he was some type of martyr. Having been a Tactical Controls instructor myself, I knew that his actions were in direct violation of all standard policies for the past 25 years. Still, people wanted to justify it in some way that made the police martyrs who were publicly crucified for their bad decisions. \n\nThe day I submitted my resignation, I was called into my division’s captain’s office. The Captain brought up a recent conversation I had while training new recruits in basic tactical controls. I made it a point when talking about restraints to point out how Chauvin’s tactics were exactly what we were trying to avoid when restraining. One of the recruits filed a complaint saying I was “promoting liberal politics” in training. I explained my position to the Captain, who listened to what I said and then replied, \n\n“Andy, you need to choose what side you’re on. Either the police, or the media.” \n\nAll of the work I’ve done for the last 15 years, all of the pedophiles and murders I’ve caught, all of the lives I’ve saved including officers, was reduced to an us vs. them mentality. I was disgusted, and walked back to my office. I typed up my resignation and returned 20 minutes later and handed it to the Captain.\n\nI’ve forfeited my full retirement since I’m not staying for the full 20 required to collect it. I don’t know what I’m doing next, but I know that I couldn’t take one more minute in that environment. I began my career to help people, and now the mission is to “preserve the profession” instead of serve the public. \n\nI haven’t told anyone the real reason I’ve quit, because I don’t want to get caught up in debates about the merit of my decision. All I know is that I’m free. I’m half-heartbroken, and half-relieved. The only way I’d work with law enforcement again is if I could start some type of training firm that focused on the best implicit bias training, and the safest tactics. I’m just not sure there’s an appetite for that among police these days. \n\nAnyway, I can’t get this off my chest anywhere else, so I’ve done it here. Sorry for the rant, but there are few that I can actually explain this to without causing a shit storm. Thanks for listening. And sorry for any grammar errors, I didn’t check it before I posted.",

Its exhausting. Its tiring.\n\nWhen i first started to game I let every comments get to me, fighting them back. Then I would get the hysterical laughter that wow they angered the gamer girl its so funny.\n\nSo next I tried laughing with them which was a lot to work towards, but I got there. But the jokes are literally the same things over and over. “Oh my gosh is this a GAmeR gIrL?!” “Oh no were gonna lose now.” “can you be my e-girl?” and as soon as you respond to one even with a laugh, they start going deeper into the sexism and disgusting comments.\n\nYesterday I was playing Valorant with my bf. First game of the day was amazing. This is the first game I have that I am really good at without months of grinding. I even clutched my first 1v3 with defuse. It was nasty asf lmfao. But directly after we got a game with maybe a 12 year old, 15, and 16. Immediately they called out me being a girl, made their jokes, then continued to make jokes for the next 5 rounds. I am immediately in a bad mood, I just start playing like absolute shit and I cant get past the mood to get any better. They took those chances to die first and watch my screen and joke about how bad i am. Mood gets worse. I never responded at any point to them. If i did i knew it would fuel them so hard. \n\nBut jesus christ can you kids just learn that making fun of woman is in no way any peak of humor and if you find it that hilarious and fun to do, you are a very very sad boy.\n\nedit: hi! this really really blew up! i just wrote the post to let it out of my system as i didnt call them out during the game via my bfs advise so it was still bugging me. i had work to get to and ive been feeling my phone going off all day and almost 300 responses have been added and ill try to read them all! thanks for reading and chatting about this! very relieved to just know im not the only one exhausted of this being such a trend still in the gaming community. hopefully we can start the change!\n\nedit 2: ive noticed a couple comments and had a very interesting dm about how i am a weak girl, socially inept, and that boys will always banter and i need to get a thicker skin. heres my thoughts on that. i get banter. i do lots of it. but you really should know your audience before you start ripping into someone. what i talked about here and what a lot of other girls and guys have talked about in the comments are not about the banter. boys genuinely just harassing and abusing girls on their games because theyre girls. a lot mention them being demeaned, some mention rape, threats, many things. banter should be both sides. when its a group of boys making fun of, making gross comments, all directed at a girl who is saying nothing back or clearly is uncomfortable, thats not banter. its harassment. its bullying. ive done banter. banter in games is fun. what i talked about in this post and what many other girls experience is not banter. boys making jokes is not black and white. stop excusing their behavior as banter.\n\nedit 3: ive gotten a lot of comments and dms saying im weak, need thicker skin, should just mute, to stop being a whiny bitch, and that everyone gets bullied in games and to just stfu. i mentioned first that i game a lot. how many times do you think i ran into toxicity? how many posts about it do you actually see from me? just this one. i had a bad game, woke up still a bit bothered, made a post specifically in a off my chest subreddit where i assumed 2 people max would read so i didnt even include a tldr and it blew up. yes i know i should have muted. i am very new to valorant still and though it should have been obvious, it didnt cross my mind during that game that lasted to a score of 12-13 so it was a really long game to sit through constant abuse.\n\nno i dont think im special. none of the woman in these comments think theyre special and deserve special treatment in games. just stop being gross.  stop sexualizing our existence. yes i know other people are bullied in games, doesnt make it any more okay. and it also doesnt take away from the problem either. doesnt make the racism in gaming okay. the homophobia. none of it is okay. just because you became complicit with it and normalize it doesnt mean its okay. the gaming community really needs to change for the better. and excusing toxicity as how men just act competitively? theres been numerous men commenting about how disgusted they are by other men. how they actively try to keep the community safer for woman. if they can do it, so can you. i dont expect the community to be banter free, but bullying isnt banter. harassment isnt banter. threats isnt banter. banter is a conversation, not one sided.",

      "body": "To make a long story short, I have had a lot of achievements in life. People viewed me as someone very smart with a lot of potential. I know that sounds braggy, so I don't want to elaborate too much, but it is relevant.\n\nI planned to become a nurse practitioner. To get my feet wet in the healthcare industry, I became a caretaker. A stepping stone if you will. I always felt so much pressure to go to school and work on my degree.\n\nMy current job is I take care of people in hospice. I help them do things like eat, shower, and yes, clean them up after they use the bathroom. Most people would be surprised by this, but my job is the highlight of my life. I feel privileged to be able to care for someone at the end of their life. I have held hands of people dying with no family around. I have pretty low self esteem, but one thing I've always loved about myself is my compassion. I was MADE for this. Every day I can tell myself that I am a good person for what I do for others.\n\nI took care of my dad in hospice, I think he would be proud to see me help others through that, degrees be damned. People call my job \"low level\" because it just requires a 6 week long class and a test for a certificate, and it involves a lot of things most people don't want to do, like wiping butts. But the people I care for LOVE me, and I love them. That love fills my heart so completely.\n\nNot continuing my education was simply not an option. Until today. I don't want to be a nurse, at least for now. I don't want to be a nurse practitioner. Right now I want to help another human by doing exactly what I do - I'm happy.\n\nOne day I may change my mind and further my education. But right now I am so happy and fulfilled in my job, why change that? Some idea of \"potential\"? I'm caring for people and that's what matters. I'm not saying nurses/nurse practitioners don't care for people, I'm saying I like the WAY I do it in my job. My job gives me the opportunity to be the most involved with the patients. My job is a job of love, that's what I was called to do.\n\nToday I accepted I am happy where I'm at. I don't care if people think it's low level. It just doesn't matter anymore. I'm happy.",

      "body": "Hey guys. It’s been a rough week. \n\n\n\nA lot has happened. I don’t really want to talk about all of it in detail so I’m going to keep this short. I know I never shut up, it’s just how I am, but I’m going to be much more brief this go around. \n\n\n\nLuke has a lawyer now. I don’t know him. But he met with Zack and Paige. To everyone saying I should have Amy arrested, I probably could have if I had shown the police the video. Instead, I just sent it to my lawyer. Maybe this makes me foolish, but even now, I think part of me is still trying to protect people I once loved and go easy on them. \n\n\n\nBut everything’s been on hold for the past few days, because Jim had a heart attack. \n\n\n\nI saw Luke and I saw Amy, and Amy’s kids, at the funeral. It was the first time we were all together since before all this happened. Nobody talked about what’s going on, short of Amy briefly apologizing for “what happened” before. She did seem sincere, I’ll give her that. But I wasn’t about to call her out anyway. Amy, Luke, and Cat all seemed pretty devastated. I was too. But we all agreed not to argue or talk about the divorce and to just let the day be a ceasefire to focus on Jim. Luke and I had a nice conversation about him. \n\n\n\nI’ve been spending time with my kids and taking a couple of days off work. I have enough of them on the back burner. Luke also saw the kids, twice, before and after the funeral, with me present. It went well. At my direction, and Sophie’s, they didn’t mention Amy, and Luke didn’t try anything funny with any of them. I think he does miss them and hate that he can’t see them, thanks to all this. \n\n\n\nThe kids are also pretty upset about losing Grandpa, on top of not being able to see Dad as much as before. I don’t think any of them blame me but that’s far from the point, frankly. Carter slept in my bed the last three nights. \n\n\n\nI’ll get more into this in the future when I have the energy to talk about what’s going on in more detail. But whoever suggested that Cat lied about the test results was correct. She never sent them in. She confessed as much to me. I guess she didn’t feel comfortable going behind her son’s back…but did feel comfortable lying to me to protect him? Until she didn’t, until she felt guilty, and she came clean. Under the circumstances, I am not angry with her, but I know better than to trust her anymore. As far as I know, she did not tell Luke about the test. But it means Tom could still be Luke's son. Probably is. \n\n\n\nMy  lawyers finished going through Luke and Amy’s letters with a finer tooth comb. The bottom line is, they definitely found what it was that Amy didn’t want me to see, and I now completely understand why she was so panicked. It has to do with why Amy and Luke didn't marry conventionally. They did something very bad. But this is genuinely something that I’m not sure I should be talking about, even on an anonymous internet post. I haven’t even been able to collect my feelings about what Amy and Luke have done, especially with everything else going on, so I don’t know if I should be more explicit. I’m sorry, I know that’s not what anyone wanted to hear, but please try to understand. Paige agreed with me, that when in doubt, don’t post it. I’ve told my lawyers to put a pin in it for now because I’m in no fit state to figure out how to proceed with it or if I should use it against them. \n\n\n\nI’m just feeling like shit, honestly. It’s difficult not to blame myself for Jim. I can only imagine Luke and Amy are blaming themselves too. I know they’re bad people. I don’t forgive them. But this tore them apart as it did me and I think all three of us feel like the divorce stressed Jim out to the point where it may have contributed. He already had heart disease. And in particular, I blame myself for showing him what I showed him. I showed him \"proof\" of the affair shortly before he died. I'll be carrying that with me for a very long time, even if I shouldn't.\n\n\n\nI’ll update again whenever I do. I’m sorry. I’ll respond to comments as I can.",

      "body": "My grandparents had a laptop at their house that we were allowed to play video games on, which was a big deal for my cousin and I because neither of us really had computers we were allowed to play games on at home. Every Wednesday, when we would go over to their house for dinner, my cousin and I would go into the office and play video games together on the computer. The games we were playing weren't that complicated (think Webkinz, Poptropica, that kind of thing), and we were young, maybe from the age of 6 to maybe 10, but practically every Wednesday the ritual was the same: eat dinner, escape into the office, and play video games. \n\nOur grandpa loved playing them with us. He didn't do everything with us, but whenever there was a difficult level, a hard puzzle, or even technical issues, he would always come back to the office and was happy to help us. He was the one that set up those accounts for us, and he kept the passwords in his fireproof safe in case we ever lost or forgot them.\n\nBut today I found out from the same cousin (who only just found out from his Mom, my aunt) that whenever we would be gone for the rest of the week, he would spend his free time each evening playing those little minigames that earn virtual money within the games we played just so when we came back we would have extra money to spend in the game. Now keep in mind that he worked a 9-5 job, and though he was always around enough, it's not like he was retired and trying to find ways to kill time. We were young, and I'm absolutely sure that we never noticed, but I'm also sure we took full advantage of the magical currency that would appear in our inventory when we would get there on Wednesday evening.\n\nOur grandpa died three years ago next Saturday, and Christmas is always hard because it was the time of year where he absolutely lit up as a person and went all out in terms of decorations, gifts, etc. I know he cared about us and loved us, but this little gesture that I had absolutely no idea about just makes his memory so much better. I miss him like hell.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your kind words. He was a good man. I’ve spent the morning crying happy tears while thinking about him. Thank y’all.",

It’s especially hard to keep my cool about it because I know my situation wasn’t even half as bad as some of the other women or assigned female at birth people who have been raped. \n\nI was in a relationship a few years ago and I was forced into unprotected sex several times. He would get pissed off, break shit, scream at me, and keep demanding until I eventually broke down and said yes. Sometimes I would be at his house and he would refuse to drive me back to my place unless I had sex with him. It also didn’t help that I felt I did not have much of a friend group either and my conservative, abstinence only upbringing made me scared to reach out to anyone about how he was treating me. When I broke up with him, he cussed me out, told me to kill myself, threatened me, and called me any awful term he could think of. \n\nThe shit thing is, it was hard to distance myself from him since we went to the same school, so he took advantage of me again. This is what led to me having a pregnancy scare. I was so scared I would have to deal with the shame of that and never be able to move on from him that I started planning suicide. I don’t think any support system would have helped, because had I been pregnant, I would have been stuck with him on some level for the rest of my life. No matter what you want to argue, you will always be tied to the parent of your child even if you’re not together. I would rather have been dead than that. I remember being so close to overdosing on pills during that time, but only stopping and hiding them when my roommate walked in. I was fortunate enough to miscarry, but not every rape victim is. \n\nI was traumatized from that, but as I mentioned before, that’s not half as bad as what it could have been. I’ve seen stories of young girls raped by family members, women raped by strangers, and abuse of power relationships. I had a small taste of how bad it could have been, but there are so many people who have similar experiences to me who do go through with suicide or end up killing themselves while trying to perform their own abortions. The pro-life movement is literally putting a fetus above a woman’s life. Literally, every fucking time I see a post about pro-life I feel PTSD from my abuse and rape. I went to therapy for years and I’m still not over it. I’ve seen women who were forced to carry their fetus to term stay in abusive relationships because of it. I’ve talked to several women with similar experiences to mine. Pro-life isn’t saving a baby, it’s jeopardizing a woman’s life. It’s empowering abusers and rapists to keep raping and rewarding them with being able to have a child and keep their victims under their thumb. Whenever I hear someone say they’re pro-life, what they don’t realize is that their stance is what would have caused my suicide.",

      "body": "My husband recently broke a bone and had to have surgery to have it repaired. The surgery was necessary for him to use his dominant hand/arm.\n\nThe billed amount was *56k* can you believe that?! Neither of us have surgery before and had no idea that medical care at a hospital was so expensive. \n\nI have always wondered why people complain about the cost of medical care and I now understand. You see, we have really great heath insurance and all we paid was a $100 copay for his procedure. I used to be pretty against universal heath insurance, because it would actually be more expensive than our current premiums. We are upper middle class and we can get out of touch by being in our bubble. \n\nAfter this event occurred, I have now realized that my opinion on universal health insurance came from a place of privilege. No one in the whole world should have to worry about the cost of necessary medical care. Had we not been able to afford to have my husbands bone fixed, he his life would have been changed forever. It makes me cry to know that people have to make these types of choices every day. I am humbled and ashamed to have been so inhuman. I have decided that I do not care how much more I have to pay in taxes, everyone should have access to health care regardless of economic status. No one deserves to have their life ruined.",

      "body": "My boyfriend was previously married in his twenties. He never talks about her much, just that it was something that happened in his life and he doesn't think of her much anymore. He's never said anything bad about her, but he has indicated that she had some mental health issues that lead to the decline of their marriage. \n\nAll in all, I figured her loss was my gain, as my boyfriend is the sweetest, kindest partner I have ever had. \n\nToday he is at work, but told me I could go into his place to hang out before he got off. I got on his laptop to watch some netflix, and found it open to facebook (yeah, he lives in the past a bit). \n\nThere was a chat box open with a woman's name. It took me a minute, but I eventually recognized it was his ex-wife. \n\nMy heckles were up, I'll admit. For a horrible few seconds I thought my whole happy relationship was about to crumble. But then I read them.\n\nShe messaged first. She seemed frantic, maybe in the midst of a mental health crisis. She told him she desperately wanted him back, and claimed he is the only man who ever treated her with kindness. She was practically begging.\n\nAnd my boyfriend responded to her that he is in a happy relationship and he will not respond to any contact like that again (and I let out I sigh of relief).\n\nBut he went on to tell her that, while they will never be able to be friends, he did believe she is a good person. But her mental health issues make it impossible for her to form a stable and healthy relationship with others. He told her he hopes she can find therapy that works for her. \n\nHe told her that he never wants to know her again, but he does hope that she can eventually have a stable and happy life. But that it won't happen until she confronts her troubles. \n\nHe ended by reiterating that he is in a relationship with someone he loves very much, and that he won't ever respond to communication from her again. But he did wish her well.\n\nHe worded it a lot more eloquently than I am able to. But I was in tears at the bittersweet feeling. It reminds me of all the reasons I love him.\n\nAnd if I were to ever speak to his ex, I would tell her that I am truly sorry for what she has to deal with. Part of me wanted to be angry that she would send a message to my boyfriend like that, but I really only feel sympathy. I'm sorry you are hurting and I am sorry for how it is affecting your life. I'm sorry it made you miss out on the wonderful relationship I have now. \n\nI hope you can find your own one day, when you are healthy.",

      "body": "It's been a year since I became the guardian and eventually adoptive father of my friend's daughter, who's 10 now. I know, unusual. I've known her almost her whole life and she's always been a great kid, so chipper and happy. I remember when I was helping my friend remodel part of his house, she was 8 at the time, she was always looking to help and either I or he would give her small jobs like measuring stuff or marking measurement lines for something we had to cut. Made her feel important and I even gave her my hat when we finally finished the job as a thank you. But the happiness wouldn't last. \n\nShe lost both of her parents last year in a car accident, she was at home with a babysitter thankfully. And at the hospital, the only family member who came was her grandparents, no one else. Not an aunt, uncle, cousins, no one. She had no one to take care of her except her grandparents, but they had health problems of their own that would have made taking care of her extremely difficult. That night in the hospital was the first time she ever hugged and held on to me, as soon as I came in to the room, and I told her \"I know sweetie, I'm here\". And so after deliberation with social services and the family, I was the only real person capable of taking care of her, an outsider, a stranger most people would think. \n\nBut after social services cleared me and my place fit for care and habitation, she moved in with me. I made it clear to her from day one that I wasn't trying to be her dad or her mom, I never could be. I was simply a caretaker and someone who cared about her and wanted her to be safe and happy, that's all. She had a breakdown that night and fell asleep in my arms from the exhaustion of the whole situation and I carried her to bed. I then went to my boss later that week and told him the situation and how I didn't want the promotion I knew I was soon to get because that would require me to travel more, and that just wasn't an option now because I had different priorities. \n\nShe slowly came around to me and knew I was someone she could trust. But other family on my side found the situation a bit odd. \"A single man taking care of some girl that isn't even his? What's up with that?\" is the general vibe I got from my family, and some more condescending or \"You're not the right person\" messages. Dead serious, they didn't like it. So I said fuck it and cut communication with most of them, the only people left being my brother, sister and my parents, who she's all met and loves btw. \n\nAnd as of October 2020, I officially adopted her as my own. We had a long discussion about it beforehand, and I made it clear that just because I was legally her dad, she didn't have to call me that, and she didn't want to. But she did want to stay with me, and that was fine by me. The day in the courtroom when it was all finalized was a little bittersweet, for obvious reasons. But I kept her promise and we visited her where her parents are buried just to say hi. Even I got a little emotional trying to just say some kind words and she held my hand to calm me down a little.\n\nI would say we're doing pretty good now. She likes when I talk about her dad and me growing up together and I even gave her some old photos of us when we were teenagers. I also told her about my time in the military. Her dad was Air Force and I was in the Army as what is now called a 91F, Small Arms/Artillery Repairer. Basically, I worked for and reported to a quartermaster on base and we tested and repaired weapons ranging from pistols to assault rifles to even huge cannons and weapons that went on AC-130 airplanes. Trust me, it wasn't always that exciting haha. But I liked it and was considering getting an engineering degree in college but instead opted for a major in IT and minor in business. \n\nOne of my fondest memories of me and her thus far would be from last year, about a month before she was adopted. I was on a Zoom meeting with other project managers (which is what I still am) from my company, including my boss, and turned my camera and mic off when I went to the bathroom. I come out and she's sitting in my chair talking up a storm to everybody asking what they're all talking about and what they're doing and it's just the cutest thing. No shyness whatsoever, she's always been like that with people and is probably why she has so many friends. It wasn't easy making her leave and she still occasionally hovers in the background curiously trying to listen in to my conversations even on the phone when I'm doing work. \n\nSorry if this dragged on. I was just looking to get this out there and hopefully brighten up someone's day. I haven't yet crossed that line and told her I love her like she's my own niece or daughter, but she knows how much I care about her and never hesitates to tell me if something's wrong. It's been rather hectic at times also, like when she accidentally caused a small grease fire (don't worry, I was there the whole time and she didn't get hurt at all and we laughed about it) and blackened one of my mom's pans, but I can't stay mad at her. Not for a second. \n\nI'll close this by just saying that I'll always be there for her, no matter what it is and that she's the most important thing in my life to me now. If you got this far, thanks for reading and I hope your day is a little brighter.\n\nEdit: Thank you all sincerely for your kind words of appreciation and praise and all the awards (whatever they do lol). This really means a lot to me. I should clarify something though: I do love her. I really do. But she's not mine, not by blood anyways. I'm not her father and never will be. I know I said I told her that I wasn't trying to replace either of her parents, and I'm not. I'm just afraid that I'll say the wrong thing. That if I do say I love her, she'll say something like \"Why would you say that? You're not my dad\" and our relationship will kind of taper off. I don't want that at all. \n\nI know her just as well as her parents did, but I can't judge what her reaction will be or when the best time to say it is. It's a mistake I can't afford to make. But it's eating me up inside not getting it out.",

      "title": "I will leave my adoptive family over night. All I leave them there will be a letter.",
      "body": "I (m18) was adopted by a family when I was five. I don't know my biological parents. The family already had three children. Three girls. Apparently after the first girl they tried for a boy but it always ended up being a girl so after three girls they adopted me to finally have a son. In the first few years of my life they treated us all well.\n\nMy \"sisters\" however were never able to accept me. They saw me as an outsider who doesn't belong in the family. Actually it was the oldest one called Alicia who poisoned the other two called Maria and Juliet against me by telling them that our parents would treat me better because I was a boy which wasn't true. In fact all three of them protested against me getting a room in the same floor as them. And my parents gave in. There was a spare room in the basement where I had to sleep now.\n\nThis however just lead to them making fun of me, calling me names like \"Cellar Rat\" and many more things. I just shrugged it off assuming thats how siblings treated each other. But I realized that having my sleeping room in the basement somehow also effected the way my parents treated me. Sleeping down there felt like I was out of sight for them. They lost interest in me and I became less significant and important. While on the other hand they started to focus more on my sisters.\n\nWhen I was 13 they completely lost interest in me. It was like I was a homeless person living in the basement. They missed all the appointments I had. They didn't care about my grades. They never even called me to eat. Sometimes I would come upstairs and see how they already took away the plates. If I was lucky there were leftovers that I could eat. Do you think I got presents for my birthday? No because they didn't even know my birthday in the first place. And last christmas they said they forgot to buy presents for me saying they will go shopping with me the next few weeks to get me something which as you might expect never happened.\n\nI don't feel despise towards my sisters. I'm glad they have a home where they are cared for and that they can feel loved. I just don't understand why they would adopt me if they just throw me away like a piece of paper? I think they just wanted to have this feeling to have a son for some time but then realized they could never love me like one of their own. And putting me into the basement was the last straw. That is when they completely banished me from their minds.\n\nAnd I just can't do this anymore. I decided to pack my things and leave. I will do it tonight. I stay at a friends house for a while and try to look for a job that hopefully gets me enough money so that I can rent an apartment. And after that I will never look back. I decided to leave a letter behind in my room. I wouldn't be surprised if they never even find it. Let alone notice that I'm gone. I use a throwaway for this but I actually don't know why. I thought I don't want them to see this but now that I think about it I could send them this post.\n\nI don't know why I even write this in here in the first place. I feel so desperate. Maybe I want this because I hope that someone is interested in me and my story.",

      "body": "“If you are reading this, I am no longer alive.” That was the first line on a note I found that my boyfriend wrote a few days ago. It felt like my heart instantly stopped beating, I couldn’t move. When I finally allowed myself to continue I didn’t understand what I was reading. \n\nMY boyfriend. The one who constantly supports me in everything I do. The one who never fails to have a smile on his face. The one light of hope in my life. I had no idea he felt like his presence on this earth was meaningless. I had no idea that he felt absolutely worthless. \n\nHe apologized to his family knowing all the pain it would bring. He thanked them for all their support but told them that there was nothing they could’ve done to prevent it. I put myself in their shoes and couldn’t possibly imagine losing a child, a brother, a best friend. \n\nThen it was my turn. “My darling, the most painful goodbye.” I wanted so badly to just stop reading and tell myself this wasn’t happening. The things he said about me.. How much I changed his life. The way he’d miss looking into my eyes, feeling my touch. He said he hopes he’d be able to look down on me, he wished I would find my true soulmate. Someone to make me happier than he ever did. All of my emotions were piling up and I could barely breathe. How could he not understand that HE is my soulmate? He is the reason I wake up in the morning, he’s the reason for every smile I make, every moment of joy I feel. \n\nThe good thing about all of this is that he’s still here with me, alive. I’m not sure what would’ve been his breaking point and when it would’ve happened. If I had found that note after the fact, my life would be very different today. He woke up when he heard me crying and asked what was wrong. I asked what the note was and began crying hysterically. \n\nHe held me and we cried together. I told him how much I needed him, how I couldn’t continue to build my life without him by my side. I told him I’d do whatever is necessary to keep him here with me. \n\nThe happiest of people can still feel so alone sometimes. Even though this was absolutely heartbreaking, I’m glad I know what he’s going through and how I can help him if he ever feels this way again.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone, SO much for all of the kind words, support and love. I have read all the comments and there’s just no way I can respond to each of them individually. Thank you all for sharing your stories, my deepest condolences go out to all of you who have lost someone you love. I am eternally grateful my boyfriend is with me today. I told him how much support he was getting from everyone and he teared up. Seriously, I can’t thank you guys enough. Your advice was amazing and I know how I can help him more than ever now!

He is usually busy studying as he’s an engineering student (I am too but he’s a grad). \n\nA few months ago he asked to be my boyfriend because he didn’t want me meeting up with anyone else on bumble. I hadn’t been messaging anyone on bumble anyway because we were talking, but I agreed and deleted the app and we became exclusive. \n\nLately he hasn’t been able to spend time together a lot. Some times we go 2 weeks without seeing each other. He’ll still text cute things about how I’m his girl and how he misses me but that’s about it. I try to give him space because I know studying is hard. \n\nWell recently my friend told me that even if you delete bumble, your account stays up if you don’t delete your account. I was creeped out by this so I downloaded the app to officially delete my account. The very first person I see when I redownload the account is my boyfriend!\n\nAnd not only that, when I scroll to the bottom of his profile, 2 of the pictures were taken while we were dating, one from only a week ago that I took myself. So that makes he’s actively going on it. \n\nSo instead of texting him to break up, I decided to be an immature brat. \n\nSo I asked my friend for her account and swiped until I found his account.

You can judge me all you want but come this Saturday he’s going to be sitting at the bar all alone and then when he inevitable texts me to come comfort him I’m going to tell him I know he’s cheating and to never talk to me again. \n\nThanks for indulging me in my petty revenge story.

      "body": "You came home this weekend, visiting from college. We’d texted asking what we could get at the store for you, and you’d replied Chicken in a Biscuit crackers and peaches. I bought a few more things because that’s what moms do. There were yogurts in the fridge, along with milk. Crispex, your favorite cereal. Some fruit roll ups. I forgot to tell you about the chocolate pie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had friends over for board games Saturday. They hadn’t met you yet. I happily told them about how you were doing in school, and your pride in your luxurious and lengthy locks. About how you’d told me your hair was softer than mine. I had made peanut butter fingers for dessert, and told them how I’d send the rest of them back to college with you. I thought you were out visiting your friends, but then you got up from a nap, and came in to say hi, and meet our friends for the first time. We smiled and introduced you. I’m glad they met you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn’t stay for dinner. You were snowed in last weekend when you came down to visit, and had a lot of friends you wanted to hang out with this weekend. I said something, I don’t remember. Was it “cya!” or “have fun!”? I almost told you to text if you’d be out late, but you’re 18, so I was trying to treat you like a grown up. You took the car out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou struggled the first quarter, last quarter. You failed the first math midterm, since your high school teachers had left you woefully unprepared. Your math teacher had a policy though, where you could get the grade in the class of either your midterms, or of your final. You decided to learn everything you should have in high school, then started relearning everything in the book from the start. You pulled off a great grade. I was so proud of you. You bragged about being a mother fucking prodigy in your CS class (you were too old to be a prodigy at 18, but I let that slide), but I was so much more proud of what you accomplished in math than of how you did in CS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou struggled with some other things too. Things you opened up about. Some addictions, anxiety, depression. After your friend killed himself last summer, you got your first tattoo. It was a semicolon with a heart at the top of it. Mental health awareness. You got it huge- most semicolon tattoos are tiny little things, but yours was a good three inches or more. You took my advice and had it done by a professional, rather than your friend with the tattoo gun, even though you had to wait a few more weeks. You had it before you left for college.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter your friend died, we made appointments with a counselor. You told me you liked her, and that she was helping. She hadn’t been taking new clients, but made an exception for you. At first I drove you to the appointments, and waited in the room outside. Then you started driving yourself to them. You started seeing someone else up at college, and they gave you the medicine you needed, and we had our first bipolar diagnosis. I warned you that it can take a while and multiple tries to find the right medication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gave you advice a lot. And I worried a lot. I told you it was my prerogative as a mom to do both. You were planning on moving out from the dorms, and I had started searching for some dump crockpot recipes to help you feed yourself. We had always talked about having me give you cooking lessons, but hadn’t yet found the time. You told me about the duplex you would rent, but never sent the link. My sister and I started filling it with imaginary furniture anyway. You’d need a bed, a dresser, a couch. Maybe, we didn’t know if it would be furnished. You knew I worried, and once you joked that I always expected the worst things to happen. About defensive driving because of other drivers on the road. About providing your own condoms instead of using ones girls provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t worry about guns. You had promised me you would tell me if you ever felt like ending it. You told me how mad you were your friend killed himself. How mad you were he acted like everything was fine, how he said he was grabbing his headphones from the car, but instead drove off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou won’t read this note. It’s Monday. I saw you last on Saturday, going to visit your friends. According to your best friend, you had a great time. You told her your usual goodbye “te amo” and left to come back home. She said you even drove parallel to each other before taking your usual turn off. But instead you went to the beach. I went there for the first time 2am Sunday. You’d sent her a suicide note. She called the police and had her sister drive you to our house. You wouldn’t answer your phone, but she had the find my friend with your location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got to the beach, but we weren’t allowed to leave the car. It was cold out, but that wasn’t why I was shivering. Your friend was crying, but your father and I were just holding hands. I knew it was bad when the officer asked for the back window to be rolled down. It was to talk to us first. I couldn’t find the button, someone else rolled it down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI miss you. So so much. I have the leftover peanut butter fingers, and that chocolate pie I hadn’t told you about. Those are only two of the many things around the house telling me about how I’ll never see you again. There will be more. I had ordered some stress reliever toys from ebay. I didn’t know if they’d make it in time for your care package this month, or if it would be next quarter. I ran out of time first quarter and used a preassembled amazon snack pack for first quarter care package, and I wanted to do a better job this time. Your best friend told me you had liked it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t sleep yesterday. I took a benadryl last night, and woke up this morning feeling almost human. Until I remembered. I’ve already started on the Kleenex. There will be more family visiting today. They keep asking if they can do anything. There are no words I need, no tasks I need done. I don’t know what to do. I can’t take back any of my previous actions, my previous words. I can try and help your father know he was a good dad, the best. You won’t get my future words. I never told you I was considering writing you a manual for how to live life. A little presumptuous I know, I never had it all figured out either. But, here’s a letter. I love you. I tried to tell you every time I dropped you off, even in college. I love you kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I can't tell you how much it has meant to read these replies. Thank you. Thank you. I may reply to more, but here's what I really wanted to say right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/as0ug6/a\\_letter\\_to\\_my\\_son/egw00sq](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/as0ug6/a_letter_to_my_son/egw00sq)",

      "body": "Yep, I did it. I lied. \n\nBackground story: My wife is a 3rd shift nurse at a major hospital in our metro area. She's been working a grueling schedule of back to back days for weeks since returning from maternity leave. Some days she doesn't even get to see me or our 3 month old son. I'm a teacher, so I'm home during the summer and I'm the primary care giver when I don't have football practice. The other night she ruined our son's sleep schedule by accident. She had a mental breakdown, tossed her glasses and broke down crying because she feels she doesn't know her own son's life and is a terrible mom. Might I add, she's a tremendous mother and wife and she makes such a wonderful impact on many peoples lives. \n\nAnyways. She came home this morning to start a streak of 3 days off. We were lying on the ground playing with our son and she tickled his tummy. He let out a big giggle and she lost it. Starting crying happy tears as it was the first giggle she's experienced; I joined along side her and we celebrated our son's first giggle together. Now she's asleep, happy and content. \n\nThat wasn't his first giggle. He's giggled with me with a few times this week. That's a secret that will go with me til the end of time. This morning will always be his first laugh, always. She deserved that moment of pure bliss and happiness.\n\nSo yeah, I lied to my wife today and I'm cool with it. That is all.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for the rewards. You guys didn't have to do that!",

She is very controlling and manipulative to the extent my wages had to be paid into her account, I had to do the housework to her specification, or else she would lash out at me with wooden spatulas. If I argued with her she lashed out. If I talked moderately (She called it \"shouting\") she would lash out. She would also deny me meals, wouldnt allow me to have my own door key, she told me I was worthless and nobody would want me. If I tried to defend myself from her attacks she said she would have me arrested and I would lose my job. Yesterday was the last straw. After being hit once again, I called the police and had her arrested. I have moved out of the home, I'm in a Bed and Breakfast tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to the council about getting accommodation.  My life is now restarting and this time I'm in the driving seat.\n\nUpdate: After her plea hearing last week where she (somehow) pled 'not guilty', I'm now going to court in Feb next year to give evidence against her in court.

      "body": "On Dec 10 I came home from work to  find all the apartment lights on. I called his name to see why he was  still awake. No answer. I got to the bedroom door and when I tried to  turn the knob it was tightly held in place, and I felt a heavy weight  press back against the door. I freaked out, screaming his name and  forcing my way into the room to find him.\n\nHe  used a belt. The bruises around his neck were a deep purple, dotted  deep from the holes in his belt. He was pale, so pale that the scars on  his chest were white. They were old deep scars that were always red. His  hands were blue, as were his feet and stomach. Shaking his arms his  hands were so fucking cold. I screamed at him to wake up. Please wake up  honey please wake up. I called 911, I tried my hardest to perform CPR.  Air simply escaped his mouth when I pressed down. My arms were BURNING  and I was sweating, and I screamed over and over again that I needed him  please don't you understand that he's all I have he's my world he's my  teammate in life I love him.\n\nIt  was to no avail. Paramedics came in, took one look at him and didn't  touch him. I held onto a paramedic woman and hyperventilated that he was  dead he was dead he was so cold I didn't know why did he do it. There  was a note on the bed. I can't really remember what it said, though I  know it wasn't much. \"I can't do this anymore. I love you.\"\n\nHe  had BPD and ADHD, but was taking proper medication and going to  therapy. He was proud of his work in therapy, and he made a point in  telling me not to worry, that he was too scared to actually kill himself. Deep down my fear never went away but I tried to be  comforted by his promises.\n\nI guess it didn't matter in the end, did it?\n\nThank  you for listening. All I do is flashback to the moment I found him all  day, every day. I don't want to morbidly bother my parents or friends  with these details. It's a hard story to hear, especially over and over  again. If I keep this inside of me I'll explode.\n\n**EDIT (Jan 5):** Everyone. The amount of messages I've read has been truly astounding. I can't fathom the thought of all these strangers taking the time to share their stories, to give me warm words, and wanting to see me move forward in a healthy way. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. \n\nSome people had a few questions, which I'll happily answer:\n\n**What type of therapy did he do?**\n\nHe was doing Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). From what I understand it was like a course with modules that he and his therapist (who he saw every two weeks, and really liked) would go through together. It involved applying emotional regulation techniques to your own life, in order to keep from basically, freaking out in a depressive or manic episode and keeping level. Like I said, he was proud of this work and used it as proof that he was doing better. Reading everyone's messages, you have reminded me that hey, he WAS proud and happy in those moments. And that's what matters. \n\n**What happened to the note?**\n\nI never touched it actually, it was on a notebook on the bed. When I had to come back to the apartment the next day, the police had taken the note, as well as his drivers license. \n\n**What kind of person was he?**\n\nMan, this is the hardest one to write. How do you describe the most wonderful person to have ever stepped into your life? He loved Muay Thai, and he had actually done a few amateur fights before we had started dated. He loved building things with his hands, like Lego and wire wrapping crystals and bending wire in bunches to look like trees. He was so sweet, he always told me I was beautiful all the time. Whenever I cooked us dinner or did something for him he would be stoked about it. That's the thing, when he was happy, he was SO HAPPY. He had a wonderful laugh. He would always make stupid faces to get me to laugh too. He would have done anything to protect me. Sometimes when I got home late from work at night and he'd be asleep, I'd go to kiss his face and he'd grab me and hold me to his chest. He was simply the best. \n\nHis name was Justin, and he had just turned 24 in August. Thank you for taking the time and energy to listen to me. I can't tell you how much it means.",

      "title": "I think my husband fathered his best friend's children, and now one of them is attracted to my daughter.",
      "body": "(All names are fake.) This began as a dark, intrusive thought that I could never shake off, and over the years it has bloomed into a poison flower that infects my entire psyche. \n\n\n\nI’m a forty-two year old woman. My husband “Luke” is 43, and so is “Amy.” I met Luke in college, but he’s known Amy since they were about 7. They did everything together and understood each other implicitly. They were best friends. They’ve always insisted that they are surrogate siblings to each other. \n\n\n\nNaturally I, as a new girlfriend, felt a little threatened by Amy and her closeness to Luke, but they both reassured me I had nothing to worry about. That their bond was not romantic and had never been sexual. That Amy really was just the sister that Luke never had. I believed them, and it didn’t take long for me to forget any and all insecurity I had about Amy. She became my friend too. She officiated our wedding. \n\n\n\nLuke and I have built a wonderful life together and we always had a strong relationship. After we got married and moved in together, we still saw a lot of Amy, and I was fine with that. I’ve passed many a night on the town trying to help Amy find a man, as she has always lamented how she is unlucky in love. Luke and I started to have children after we were married, and, at around the same point, so did Amy. \n\n\n\n*For further context, my children are Sophie, (15) Owen, (12) Louise, (10) and Carter (6)* \n\n\n\n*Amy’s children are Tom, (17) Kaylee, (14) and twins, Adam and Jenna, (9)* \n\n\n\nNow, Amy was not in a relationship at this point. She was not married. As far as I knew, she was “dating” but not consistently. As Luke and I had more kids and our family grew, periodically Amy would find herself pregnant as well. It happened a few times, and Luke and I never knew anything about the father(s) in question. I kind of assumed that maybe Amy was sleeping around and not keeping in contact with her one-night stands. Luke agreed this was probably the answer. While I did ask each time if Amy knew the paternity, she always said no, and she didn't seem that worried about the idea of raising kids on her own, so I didn’t pester her. \n\n\n\nOf course, she had us to support her, so there was that. While Amy never asked for any help, of course Luke was never going to let his best friend struggle to stay afloat when she had children to raise. Financially, we are very fortunate and privileged. I have a job that pays handsomely and Luke also had wealthy parents who already knew and loved Amy, so they were happy to provide for her. (My in-laws defy all stereotypes, they are the kindest and gentlest people.) So we were able to support Amy. To get her somewhere to stay with her kids. People might be tempted to call her a leech, but I never saw it that way. None of us did. She needed help and we could provide it. \n\n\n\nI also know people are going to criticize her for her lack of responsibility and question why she never used more reliable birth control. Honestly? That is a long story that I don’t want to get into because even I don’t fully understand her reasoning, but it was quite important to her that she never be on birth control and that whatever came of that choice, she would accept. It wasn’t religiously motivated, I know that, but it was that degree of significance to Amy. She really did not want to take birth control. She’s explained it to me more than once but I’m still not clear on why. \n\n\n\nOf course, Amy being Luke’s best friend since they were kids, it’s not unreasonable that sometimes they hang out together while I’m not there. Hey, that’s fine. Sometimes I hang out with Amy one-on-one as well, though Luke does it more. She was his friend first. This included him going over to where she was staying and at times, sleeping over there. Was I a fool to trust him and believe nothing was going on? Perhaps. But for years, they presented as being “buddies.” Like siblings. I didn’t pick up on any vibes between them, not ever. As one can expect, our children were brought up together. Not in the same house, (our home is decently sized but even we don’t have the room for eight kids.) But we made sure Amy’s children met ours from a young age, and they always got along and strong bonds of friendship have formed over the years, which is good. Especially if I’m right, and they share blood. \n\n\n\nI’ve been dawdling getting to the main point. Yes. I have come to suspect that Luke fathered at least one of Amy’s kids, if not all of them. Frankly, I do suspect they are all his. I would never have believed my husband to be capable of such a thing, and he’s given me no indication that he is the unfaithful sort. But he does spend a lot of time with Amy, and I have to confess I cannot remember seeing her with any real boyfriend over the years. She would talk to men at bars and parties, I would try to be her wing-man, and so on. But nothing ever seemed to really happen, so when she got pregnant the first time, I was curious. When it happened again, and again, I began to wonder if she had some sort of secret fella who she didn't want us to know about for whatever reason. But I couldn’t think of any reason why she would hide him, especially from her children. \n\n\n\nAfter Carter, our youngest, was born, Luke and I agreed that the time had come for him to have a vasectomy. Amy’s twins had come just a couple of years prior. Of course, after the procedure, Luke and I continued to make love but I no longer had to think about pregnancy. Meanwhile, Amy never got pregnant again, after the twins. Is it a coincidence that Luke had a vasectomy and then both of us stopped getting pregnant? I don’t know. But Luke would still visit her, and he wasn’t just going to see her, but checking up on her children as well. In general, I should have paid more attention to it sooner, but Luke has always acted like a father to them, especially as they’ve gotten older. He’s the father they never had. He doesn’t neglect me, or our children, not one bit. He’s doing double duty. On its own, the idea that he is a surrogate father to Amy’s fatherless children isn’t inherently suspicious. One could call it noble. But it combines with a lot of other little things. \n\n\n\nThere is appearance as well. I won’t go into specifics of hair color, eye color, or unique physical traits, because I’d rather limit the identifying factors of the people involved and keep this whole thing as vague as possible. But suffice it to say, Amy’s children…they certainly look like they could be Luke’s. Kaylee has a very unusual allergy that Luke also has. The twins look very much like him - Adam in particular. The older Tom has gotten, the more of Luke I can see in his face and personality. While their race doesn’t matter, the reality is that Luke is a different race than Amy, and Amy’s children look pretty biracial. I could easily believe their father is the same race as Luke. Doesn’t mean Luke has to be the father, but…it sure seems like it. \n\n\n\nI have never voiced my anxieties to either Amy or Luke. I don’t want to be the “bad guy” and, guilty or innocent, I already know they would flatly deny my accusations and be hurt by them. Imagine if that drama reached the ears of my kids, or Amy’s kids? Either way, Luke continues to spend time with Amy and her children, just as her children spend time with mine. I have hinted to Luke that I feel needy for more attention and wish he wouldn’t give as much to Amy. But he either missed my cues or pretended that he missed them. I don’t want to push this idea that he’s favoring her, because it’s not even really true. He’s never neglected me for her. I just. I can’t shake the feeling that Luke and Amy have been intimate before, likely numerous times. \n\n\n\nSo far as I know, Amy never really wanted to be a mother, either. She wasn’t opposed to it, and when each of her children came into the world she instantly fell in love with them, but motherhood was never really a major part of her life plan or identity. In the grand scheme of things, when we would talk about the future, she would sometimes mention a husband and children, but it never seemed like something she had her heart particularly set on. So like, I don’t think this is a case of Luke just “giving” Amy children, I doubt that was the motive for the infidelity. That would have been a side-effect. \n\n\n\nI’ve been letting this go and turning a blind eye for years. It was a dark thought in the back of my mind after Kaylee's allergy was discovered, but I dismissed it. Got worse after the twins were born. I dismissed it. Then, when Amy stopped having babies, I wanted to feel reassured by that. But, Luke had gotten a vasectomy, so if anything, that made my anxiety worse. There have been nights that I wished the twins were younger, that they had come along after Luke’s procedure. It’s been twisting me into knots for a long time, but I don’t want to be the one who rips our family apart especially since, technically, I could be wrong. \n\n\n\n**Except now I’m very afraid, because in the last few months we’ve had a new development in our kids’ social circle.** \n\n\n\nTom, Amy’s eldest, asked Sophie out. Sophie, my eldest. She’s really blossomed over these last few years and become quite the outspoken beauty, so I’m not shocked to see she’s getting male attention, but Tom asking her out had me thrown. Sophie said no, but only because I’m quite protective when it comes to her exploring dating, and she knew she’d have to ask me first. I could tell she was flattered and intrigued by his interest and wanted to say yes. She approached me to talk to me about it, bless my girl, she did everything right. I think she expected I would see things her way and agree that she could date Tom. Much to her surprise, I very firmly said no. That caused a bit of conflict. She didn’t even want to date him that badly, she just couldn’t understand why she wasn’t allowed to. And I couldn’t explain it to her. All I could come up with was “He’s too old for you” which he is, but it’s not really about that. \n\n\n\nWhen Amy and Luke heard, I was so very curious to see what their reactions would be. If either of them had agreed with Sophie and tried to convince me that the two of them should be allowed to date, I think I would have been relieved and taken that as proof that I was wrong about something going on between them. Wrong about who fathered Amy’s children. But, the ambiguity continued. They took my side. Both of them put their foot down, though not as fiercely as I did. Luke agreed with me, but he also worried that trying to forbid such a romance would only make Sophie want it more. He’s probably right about that. Amy seemed more apathetic to the idea. She didn’t want Tom to date Sophie either, and she backed me up, but I don’t know, she just wasn’t taking it as seriously. She seemed to think it was a fleeting crush. \n\n\n\nWell, it wasn’t. In the months following those conversations, Tom would spend more and more time with Sophie. They would be alone (or with “other friends”) any time they possibly could. It’s become abundantly clear that Tom is crazy about Sophie and wants to be with her. (And he definitely wants to be physical, I’ve been watching them like a hawk and noticed his eye wandering many times.) And while I’m doing everything I can to kill this budding romance in the crib, I also am feeling somewhat powerless. Sophie hasn’t outwardly defied me, she’s still just hanging out with Tom “as friends.” So forcing them to stop spending time together would be unreasonable, and probably encourage more sneaking around. But I’m so afraid that they’re already doing that. My nightmare is that they’re secretly dating, and doing god knows what when no one is looking. (I’ve observed Tom being rather handsy with Sophie, and she presents no objection whatsoever.) And I just don’t know what to say. I had considered trying to convince Sophie that Tom is “like” her brother, but if she doesn’t see him that way, I don’t really have the power to rewrite their emotional dynamic or the history of their friendship. I always saw Amy and her children as being like family, but my kids might see Amy’s kids more as “best friends.” \n\n\n\nThe problem is, of course, that if my husband has indeed been carrying on an affair over the years and I’m right about the paternity of Amy’s children, then Tom and Sophie cannot be anything more than friends under any circumstances, end of discussion. It can never happen. I feel powerless to stop it, though. Luke has apparently “talked” to Tom about this, as has Amy, but he is unrelenting and he won’t give up on Sophie. I think she enjoys that attention and devotion. Tom has also confronted me and asked why I’m so against this when I know him very well and I know he would be good to Sophie. I didn’t know what to say other than to fall back on her being too young for him. But that won’t work forever. If, god forbid, they’re still attracted to each other in a few years, then they’ll pursue this with abandon and once they’re legal adults, there’s nothing I can do about it. \n\n\n\nAmy and Luke agree with me that Tom cannot date Sophie, but that’s all they’ve really done. They feel just as powerless as me to prevent “teen love.” It genuinely feels sometimes like they’ve just given up and will bury their heads in the sand about this. Just do nothing and hope the feelings pass as Tom and Sophie get older. Which, yeah, they’re in high school. It’s unlikely Tom will be in love with Sophie forever. But my fear is that she’ll let him do something intimate with her before that time comes, something neither of them can take back. I am this close to opening a door I cannot close, this close to screaming at Luke that all this wouldn’t be happening if he hadn’t cheated on me these many years. If he hadn’t been all but raising a second family with his “surrogate sister” behind my back. Now Luke’s son wants to fuck our daughter, his ACTUAL sister, because as far as he knows, she’s just his childhood friend. And it’s all Luke and Amy’s fault for what they’ve done.\n\n\n\nIf I speak up, everything gets blown to hell. On the off chance that I am wrong, I’m a horrible monster who accused the love of my life and one of my closest friends of doing something horrible. If I’m right, it still tears our entire structure apart. The family and social unit we’ve become over the last several years is gone, and everyone will be stressed and upset even if Luke and I don’t divorce. If I do nothing, Sophie’s eventually going to sleep with Tom and be his girlfriend. (And I’m low key terrified it will happen sooner than later, or worse, that it’s already happened under my nose.)  I hope to hell this relationship fades as they mature, but what if it doesn’t? What if they wind up being together for years? What if they marry, want to get pregnant someday? \n\n\n\nAnd if I tell Sophie the truth about Amy’s kids, then everyone else finds out too, and that’s going to ruin so many lives. It would shatter my kids’ perception of their father, and their “Aunt Amy.” Luke is Owen’s hero. I don’t even want to think about how much this would hurt him. And what about Amy’s children? They are innocent. They didn’t ask for this, they don’t control where they came from, and I don’t want to hurt them. Admittedly I’m not happy with Tom at the moment. A week ago I saw him put his hand on Sophie’s butt and I wanted to knock his teeth out. But even he doesn’t deserve to be burdened by the knowledge that it’s his half sister he’s been fantasizing about. \n\n\n\nIt’s all so fucked up and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been looking the other way and letting my husband and his “best friend” insult me for such a long time now. I thought I could live with it. But this business with Tom and Sophie has me distressed.",

      "body": "Reddit won't let me post a link, so you'll have to find the original post on my account page, sorry for the inconvenience. I could summarize the original, but these posts are already quite long as it is, and frankly, the TL;DR is in the title anyway. So here goes: \n\n\n\nFirst of all, wow. I did not expect my post to get as much traction as it did. I was half worried that someone in my family or social circle might find it, especially when someone alerted me that the post had been shared to facebook. But, as far as I can tell, no one in my family has seen it. I want to thank all of the kind commenters who wished me well. To those who were more frustrated with my indecision, I get it. But I was operating with an uncertain situation and the stakes were incredibly high. I feel like no matter what choice I made, something could and likely would go wrong. I’ve spent the last five years imagining different scenarios based on different ways I could go about this if I ever decided to act on it. To everyone who was clamoring for an update, I have one for you. \n\n\n\nI previously said that I was going to do a secret DNA test, that I had decided on that course of action. In the end, I couldn’t go through with it, and now I am regretting that, because the window to do so has essentially closed. I just felt like it would be out of line for me to do that to another person’s child behind their back. Ethically, it was dicey. I’ve since consulted with my lawyer as many commenters suggested, and she advised me against doing so, because no matter what the results were, it would make me look bad in a potential divorce proceeding. But I really wish I had done it anyway, and just not told anyone. Because I really, badly need to know, and I still don’t know for sure. Likewise, I wanted to tell Sophie in confidence, but the more I thought about it…even that seemed over the line. Like I had no right to plant such ideas in her mind about her father without even talking to him first. \n\n\n\nSo, what I ended up doing was confronting Luke and Amy. Many comments suggested this as well. I finally told both of them that we needed to have a serious talk. It felt counterproductive to approach just one of them, because I figured they would tell the other about what happened in their own words before I could prepare my own. I wanted them both to hear what I had to say. Once all the kids were at school, I laid down all of my suspicions and the reasons. I made it clear how much I love both of them, but a combination of clues had led me to notice the similarities between Luke and Amy’s children - and I didn’t even list all of them in the original post. (For example, Luke has been a sleep-walker in the past. So have Sophie, Tom, and Adam) I said over and over, how much they meant to me and how I didn’t want to believe it, but the thought had crept into my mind in the past. How I had dismissed it before, but now, with Tom and Sophie having crushes on each other, it became necessary to pose the question. So I asked if they had ever crossed the line, if Luke had ever been unfaithful, if there was even the slightest possibility that any of Amy’s children were his. I was just trying not to cry. \n\n\n\nWell, they reacted exactly as I would have expected. Their responses were perfect and so very well rehearsed. I genuinely can’t tell if it was honest emotion or powerful gaslighting. Amy was more upset than Luke, or at least more outwardly upset. She was angry, offended at the accusation. Luke just seemed heartbroken by it. Maybe they were just acting, but I don’t know. Somehow, they had reasonable responses to all of the points I brought up. They asked questions I didn’t know how to answer. I had never objected to them having alone time before, why did it suddenly bother me now? Do Amy’s children really resemble Luke that much, or are things like hair color pretty basic traits to have in common? The whole family had always treated Amy and her kids as part of our unit, and I had previously commended Luke for stepping up and being a father to Amy’s kids since they didn’t have one…why was I now saying it was a bad thing? What exactly did I want them to do? How could I think such a thing about them? Why had I waited so long to say something? \n\n\n\nLuke was more understanding than Amy. He respected my feelings, or at least he acted like he did. Amy appeared to feel more betrayed by what I said. I ended up apologizing several times even though I’m not sure I did anything wrong. Luke also apologized for “anything he’d done” to indicate he was unfaithful. I asked Amy more pointedly that, if not Luke, who HAD fathered her children? She snapped back that it was none of my business, and I could tell she was in no mood to get personal or vulnerable with me after my accusations. I’m not proud to say that I lost my temper, and said that after everything we had done for her and her children, such information was not a lot to ask and perhaps she owed it to us. I regretted the words as soon as I said them, but Amy shouted back that \\*I\\* had never done anything for her, that it was Luke and his parents who had kept her afloat all these years, not me. She went on a longer tirade about how I had always acted superior to her, which I don’t believe I did, though it’s possible that I gave off that vibe unintentionally. Luke did his best to calm her down, but the room was still fraught with tension.  \n\nI don’t know, Reddit, I just don’t know. It’s driving me to the edge of madness. There is a way to be certain, of course. Not certain of my husband’s fidelity, but of the paternity of Amy’s children. So I asked Luke, for my own peace of mind, for the sake of our daughter, and for our family unit, if he could please get a DNA test done, a paternity test. I went on to say that I knew he disliked and distrusted such things, but that I really needed this. I could see the pain in Luke’s eyes. Maybe it was an act, but he did seem genuinely hurt that I was asking for this, that him giving me his word that he had always been faithful was not enough for me. But he very reluctantly agreed to participate in a DNA test. Unfortunately, Amy did not, and that’s where we hit a roadblock. I was afraid of this. But Amy was infuriated at the whole concept and told me in no uncertain terms that I would not be getting samples of her children’s DNA and basically told me to fuck off for asking, several times in several variations. I pressed Luke, and honestly he was a bit useless but probably right. He tried to convince Amy but she wouldn’t hear of it, and he kind of shrugged to me when I pushed him for further support. Because he can’t force her to get the tests done, if she refuses, that’s really a dead end. Trust me, it is, I looked into this quite a bit and consulted with my lawyer. \n\n\n\nThe problem is, Luke could, in theory, petition the court to demand a paternity test for Tom and the others. The issue is that, to do this, he’d essentially be claiming he slept with Amy and he believes her children to be his. That would be the version of events he’d be maintaining. But Luke has staunchly insisted that nothing ever happened with Amy. That he never cheated on me. Whether or not he’s being honest about this is another story, but he’d essentially have to go on record and make a claim that he isn’t prepared to make. He is quite certain the children aren’t his and he has no intention of fighting for custody of them. So no judge is going to compel Amy to submit samples of her children’s DNA. Tom is also old enough that his consent would be a factor. If both he and Amy refuse to participate in the test, it’s unlikely that Luke would have a case. He’d have to “target” one of Amy’s younger children, like say, one of the twins. But he doesn’t want to do that. He doesn’t want to take his best friend to court to prove something that, in his words, he already knows isn’t true. Luke is asking me to please just let this go, and trust him, because pursuing this will fracture everything. And according to my lawyer, it’s not realistic anyway. For Luke to establish paternity, he would need to admit to an affair in the first place, and he’s not doing that. And if he did, that would pretty much be all the proof I needed to be certain, even if I’d need more in a court case. \n\n\n\nI pestered him further about Tom and Sophie. Insisted that I didn’t want them dating. Luke agreed, and apparently Amy still agrees. Luke plans to have a talk with Tom and activate protective papa bear mode. Among other things, he’s going to remind Tom that in a couple of months when he turns eighteen, him being intimate with Sophie will literally be a crime. I…wouldn’t actually press charges against him as I know he’d never do anything against Sophie’s will, but I’m not above implying the threat. Thankfully, Luke isn’t either. I did ask him if he’d be open to potentially swiping a sample of Tom’s DNA to do a private paternity test, but he was very hesitant about the idea. Like me, he viewed it as unethical. He also pointed out that if we were to do this and Amy found out, it would mean the end of our friendship with her, most likely. Things are, Luke believes, still in a salvageable state, where Amy and I could reconcile and become friends again, and I can see how much he wants this to happen. But, if I did a DNA test on Tom behind Amy’s back and she found out, I think she would hit the roof and I wouldn’t entirely blame her. Though I’d be very interested to see the results. Luke ended up going to see Amy and spending the night. I know all of you are cringing and throwing up your hands, and trust me, I wasn’t happy about it. That was a very long conversation. But he was adamant that he needed to perform damage control. So they spent the night together. With Luke maintaining that nothing happened. I did not sleep a wink and I kept texting him for updates. So far as I can tell, Amy will cool off, but she needs a little time. \n\n\n\nLuke and I talked things over when he came back the next morning. It was an emotionally fulfilling conversation and we ended up agreeing to take the kids (our kids, not Amy’s) to visit their grandparents for a few days. It was an impromptu visit but we’ve done it before and they were delighted to have us. I just really wanted our family to spend some time together away from Amy’s “side” of the family, so to speak. I always love getting to see my in-laws. (I’ll refer to them as “Jim” (75 M) and “Cat” (67F) . I know Reddit is famous for stories about the “MIL from hell” but in my life that couldn’t be further from the truth. I feel safe with them. To the point that, when they took notice of how distant Luke and I were from each other, I finally relented and confessed my fears. I told them of my anxiety that Amy and Luke were having an affair, and that Amy’s children might be his. Here’s where things got a little bit interesting. When I told them what I was feeling, Cat just gave Jim this pointed look, and did a big, dramatic sigh. \n\n\n\nSo it turns out, Cat has had similar misgivings to mine and genuinely suspected over the years that Luke and Amy were closer than they’d ever admit, that they had crossed the line in the past. Jim, on the other hand, simply refuses to even consider the idea. He has always insisted that Cat is seeing things that aren’t there. He maintains that Luke and Amy are “like siblings” and would “never” do such a thing. Cat thinks his stance on this is naive and that, even if she and Jim had taken Amy in and loved her like a daughter, that didn’t mean Luke viewed her as a sister or that she viewed him as a brother. But Jim just continued to insist that this is what they are and had always been. I could tell that he and Cat have already had this conversation before, and they kept going in circles, with Cat getting exasperated. She pointed out that, surrogate siblings or not, Luke and Amy were not actually brother and sister, so nothing was stopping them from being physical together if they felt a mutual attraction. At that point, Jim just sighed and walked away from the conversation. So yes, Cat has privately wondered if Amy’s children weren’t fathered by Luke, which is part of why she has always treated them as her grandchildren. Which was never something that I minded, to be clear. I also don’t mind that Cat never voiced these concerns to me. She had no proof, and she saw far less of Luke and Amy’s closeness in our adult lives than I did. \n\n\n\nAs for the kids? They’re doing alright. I don’t know what Amy told her children, but I think the general consensus, the “official” version of events, is that Amy and I had a “fight” and need a “break” from each other. That’s what Luke and I told our children, and when pressed for more information, Luke did defend me and shut down the questions, saying it wasn’t their business. I don’t know if Amy kept to that version of events, but my children and her children have each other’s phone numbers and social media, so they’ve presumably still been in contact over the last two days. I think my kids would have kept Amy’s kids in the loop on the updates, and if Amy had told them anything else significant, they would have relayed that information to my kids. After all, we know Sophie and Tom are very close. I did try and talk to Sophie about that more, but the timing was off, because Sophie rejected my counsel and interpreted my reinforced reluctance as being attributed to my fight with Amy. She maintained that she wasn’t dating Tom (to what degree that’s actually true…I don’t know.) But she was going to remain close friends with him and while she isn’t usually a disobedient child, she made it very clear that she was putting her foot down on this one, and, to be fair, I can’t really justify trying to separate them or forbid them from being friends. They’ve known each other for years. Luke has my back on them not being allowed to date, but he wouldn’t have my back on them not hanging out anymore. \n\n\n\nI wish I had a more definitive update. If anything significant happens in the next few days, I can let you guys know. I’m mostly just kicking myself for not having done the secret test, even for my own peace of mind, as now I feel like I’m locked out of the only way to get definitive proof one way or the other.",

      "body": "Update: I can't post a link but I made an update in a new post. \n\nMy wife, Em, met her best friend, Chuck, in high school. They became close friends and Chuck came out to Em as gay. Em was supportive. A year or so later Chuck came out to his parents. They disowned him and kicked him out, and Chuck ended up living with Em and her parents for the rest of high school.\n\nEm and I started dating after college and she told me all about Chuck and how close they were and how he was like a brother. I met Chuck and we got along and became friends. Chuck is a good guy. At the time Chuck was dating a guy, they ended up moving in together about the same time that Em and I got engaged. Em and I have been married for 5 years now.\n\nI'm a Project Manager and took on a year-long project in another city. I have to leave at 5:30AM every morning and get home around 6:30PM. Em and I had a long talk about my job before I took on this project. We knew it would be a sacrifice for me to be working so much, but I'm getting more money than I ever thought I would. After this project we can pay off our student debt and start trying to have a baby. We both agreed the money was worth it, since it's only a year. That year will be up in late November.\n\nIn March Chuck caught his boyfriend cheating. He was devastated. Em immediately told him he could move in with us.  I was fine with him moving in, but not happy that Em didn't even discuss it with me first. Chuck was pretty broken up and Em was giving him lots of love and attention. I was fine with it, because I know how much she loves Chuck and he did need her. I also did my best to support him and make him feel loved.\n\nFor a while this was fine, but as time went on Em has continued to pour all of her attention into Chuck. Sometimes I get home from work and neither of them are there, and I found out they went to a movie or out to dinner together. I don't think there is anything romantic or sexual between them, but it has been annoying that I get left out of all the plans.\n\nThe past few weeks several things have happened. The 3 of us went to a party and someone joked about Chuck being our 3rd wheel and Em said \"Chuck is not the 3rd wheel.\" I said \"what?\" and she said \"I've known Chuck longer than I've known you!\"A week or so after that Em and Chuck went out dancing one night. I had to work the next day so I stayed home. I woke up at about 3AM and Em was not in bed. I went and found her and Chuck cuddled up on the couch asleep with the TV on.Both of those things made me uncomfortable. I also realized I had been working so much I was just sort of letting Em and Chuck plan everything, and I had not planned a date night in a while. I decided I needed to be more active and so I planned a date night for last Friday. When I first told Em she was excited, as we have not been on a date just the 2 of us in a while.\n\nFriday I got home at 6:30 and Em and Chuck were not there. I took a shower and got ready. About 7:15 I finally called Em, as we had reservations at 8. She answered and when I asked where she was she said her and Chuck had gone shopping and were getting some dinner. I was kind of stunned and asked about our date. She laughed and said \"oh I forgot! oh well!\" and that was that. She didn't even invite me to join them.\n\nSo, a point I should make here: my dad was very controlling of my mom and had an anger problem where he would yell and throw things. He never threw things at us, but it was still scary as a kid. I have worked very hard to not be like him.\n\nI've tried to never be controlling of Em or tell her what to do. I also tend to shut down when I get angry. When Em forgot our date I was mad so I didn't say anything right then, but I knew I needed to address how I was feeling. So later that evening I told her we needed to talk. I had written down some things so I could stay focused. I started by saying that I loved Chuck and he was always welcome in our home, but that I felt like our marriage was suffering and we needed to work on us. Em blew up. She thought I was attacking Chuck (I guess I didn't word things well) and she started defending him and attacking me. We have never had a big fight before, we always talk and work things out. I was stunned that she was attacking me. She said some awful things.\n\nThen she said \"Chuck is my soulmate and you just have to get used to that.\"\n\nI just shut down. I didn't even know how to process that. I love Em more than anything in the world, but in that moment I realized she loves Chuck more than she loves me. I thought Em and I were soulmates, but to hear her say she considers someone else her soulmate has been devastating.\n\nI don't remember the rest of the talk. She huffed off after a while and slept on the couch. Her and Chuck left together on Saturday and were gone most of the day. When they got back she acting like nothing had happened. On Sunday she even made a small joke and batted her eyes at me, something she does when she's flirting with me. Normally I love it, but this time it just made me sick.\n\nI told her this was a busy week at work and I was just going to stay at a hotel near the job site (something I have done a few times before) so I haven't seen her since Sunday night. I don't know what to do. Typing all of this up has made me realize I am really burned out with all of this travel. Maybe I checked out too much and haven't given her enough attention. But how do I move forward knowing she will never love me as much as I love her?\n\nMinor update: Seeing a bunch of comments from women who say they have more than one soulmate has given me hope. To me you only have one soulmate, but that's not a word Em or I ever really use and I just really hope she means it different than how I took it. We have been texting back and forth some this week, and we spoke on the phone last night. It wasn't anything big, she just called and said she missed me and couldn't wait until I got home (I'll be home tonight.) I told her we should talk about our fight last Friday and she agreed and said she hates that we fought and we need to work it out. She said she loves me. We will be talking tonight and I guess I'll find out where I stand.",

She suffered from mental health issues most of her life and I guess I knew this might happen one day, but I didn't think it would be yesterday.\n\nThe police came and went. \"We're sorry for your loss.\" \n\nSome friends came and picked me up, I'll be staying in the guest room for a bit I guess. My family came to pick up my son, he'll be 3 in April. My sister in law is going to look after him so at least he'll have his cousins to play with him. I had to comfort her mother, who blames herself. I had to call my job to tell them I needed some time. I had to call estranged friends, having them disseminate to others I couldn't reach. Got drunk. Took an Ambien. Slept. Went to the carwash with a friend. Stayed there until 3am. Watched Space Jam when I got back. Talked to my dead wife in the rain. \n\nIt's been a rollercoaster of tears and laughter and silence and I have so my questions that can wait.\n\n The weirdest thing is though, I'm feeling intensely aroused and I'm having trouble falling asleep. Normally I masturbate to help myself drift off and believe me, I want to. But I don't think I can. Looking at porn seems... disrespectful? And I can't close my eyes without seeing her so...

      "title": "As a veteran, I wish people would stop glorifying military service. It's a sacrifice, but it often destroys veterans more than it helps them and mostly does not affect citizens' way of life.",
      "body": "I met two young veterans with Degenerative Disc Disease. One was twenty six. TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD. The other was 28, which is still young. I have it myself as well, and I'm not even in my thirties. An older (40s or 50s) vet I know is permanently in a back brace. Then another with hip issues at 24.\n\nAnd the list goes on. All of us signed up to serve our country and to get the benefits we required to succeed in life. It sucks how often I run into vets who have been chewed up and spat out by the military: in all branches, in many countries, and in many jobs.\n\nYet, citizens and the country's \"leadership\" tell people it is an amazing calling to serve one's nation.\n\nBut all of those vets and myself all had the same conversation. \"I served, but I feel like I did not make any impact on the lives of the citizens in my country. I feel like nothing changed during my time.\"\n\nVeterans are heroes in their own right and they deserve the respect they earned. But it always bothers me how people paint military service as if it is this glorifying thing where each and every military member will uphold \"freedom\" for everyone and be modern day heroes. Military members are often used to protect \"assets\"; whether it is equipment or land. It's really not what everyone expects it to be. During that \"protection\" they are put through grueling physical pain and punishment. Wearing gear almost twice their weight and living in subpar conditions.\n\nThe grim reality: it's painful, grueling, time consuming, and emotionally taxing to be a military member. Long work weeks, lost weekends/holidays, brutal working/living conditions, and terrifying situations. Some are lucky to avoid these situations, but not everyone is so lucky. The heroes are often mangled by their heroic acts or die from them. They are brave selfless acts and deserve their attention, but these types of situations are rare.\n\nSuicide rate among veterans in America is staggering. Many are left without any support and feel the only answer is to end it all.\n\nVA benefits can be helpful, but are hard to acquire and keep track of. Military medical often screws vets out of proper continuing healthcare once they leave the service. A doctor's notes can prevent someone who desperately needs life long healthcare from receiving it based on either bias, selfishness, ignorance, or negligence. I walked on a torn calf muscle for a year due to a lazy \"doctor\". I finally sought advice from a different doctor. He did the proper work to identify the issue. Thanks to his help I healed. Albeit, it took years to heal from it and I hope it does not come back to haunt me later in life. But I received 0 benefits for a doctor's negligence. A friend of mine has a hair line crack in his pelvis from his service. He has received 0 benefits for it. A retired officer I know has permanent nerve damage from an improper injection done on her arm in prep for a deployment. She does not earn 100% benefits for that damage. She only receives 50%. Yes, it is something that helps, but someone's negligence has left her with life long pain. She still has to pay out of pocket for pain management for this issue.\n\nTo those who still serve, thank you for what you do, because I know you are in pain: physically, mentally, and emotionally. If you believe what you are doing is right, then please keep that going for yourself. Get what you need out of your service and enjoy it. Seek proper healthcare and make sure your notes reflect the actual issue. Take care of your mind and body.\n\nFor those who served and are in pain, thank you for your sacrifices, but I hope you can heal mentally and physically. Find help if you need it. Reach out to your friends and family. Never be afraid to get help. Your life may depend on it.\n\nTo those who just started their military career, please take care of your body from the start. Take advantage of your health benefits. You will run into people who think you are trying to \"scam\" the system or are weak. Forget about them. You only get one body and one mind. Take care of both of them equally. Make sure you are provided the ppe you need and require.\n\nIf you are on your way out, be prepared to figure out a lot of things on your own. Yes, there are VA benefits, but often times you will have to fight for those benefits or have to know more than the VA reps. Know your rights and take care of them.\n\nTo the people who say they support veterans, then actually support them when they need it. Notice when they lose their benefits and listen to them when they need help. Many vets need continuing medical care after service. And most of all, stop glorifying military service to the younger generations as if they will become heroes and earn medals like the old war stories. Those stories are rare and leave out the scars left behind. Educate the younger generation and let them know the truth of what they will get into. It is their right to serve and their right to do something they believe is right, but make sure they understand the reality of it. Not everyone that joins becomes a hero and not every hero survives their wounds.\n\nJobs that actually serve the country, community, and citizens: firefighters, medical workers, city workers, community service jobs, T E A C H E R S, counselors, therapists, food workers, retail workers, construction workers, social workers, local govt (depending), plumbing, electricians, national guard (depending) and many more jobs that involve community work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words of encouragement, support, and understanding. I value all of the things that were said on this post. To all those that served, thank you for what you did. I hope the best for all of you still in pain. For those who have experienced loss, I am so deeply sorry. I hope you find peace as well. You deserve happiness as well. \n\nFor those who might think I do not like veterans or that I do not think service is worthy of praise, that is far from the truth. I just wish people would not glorify service as the end all be all for service to one's country and community. If it is one's calling then that is fine and I do not dislike them for their choices. There are other routes in America that people can serve and change the country for the better.",

      "body": "We were searching him all morning when I suddenly heard my mother scream in panic. My little sister came running towards me, repeating my brothers name along with something I couldn’t make out. I feared that he had fallen badly, perhaps. So I ran to where I thought my mom‘s scream came from. She was standing in front of the garage, crying. My dad was inside, shaking what looked like my brother’s body. He kept shouting his name, trying to slap him awake, but my brother seemed unresponsive. I knelt down beside them. My brother’s lips were black and he had dark spots all over his face. I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him a couple times. No response. In the back of my mind I knew that he wouldn’t wake up from this, but it just didn’t feel real.\n\nWe are still not entirely sure what happened, the police is still investigating. It seems like his room was so heated up last night that he decided to sleep in the garage.  He burned some charcoal to make it more cozy. He locked himself in, however, as our garage can only be opened from the outside with a pin code. As the fire burned down he ran out of oxygen.\n\nDespite our entire family and friends having been here by now, both of my parents have not eaten all day and seem utterly disillusioned. My dad barely talks.\n\nFelix was 2 years younger than me, he turned 16 this January.\nOnly a few hours before he died he told me that he was going to have a date on Saturday which he was looking forward to and asked me what he should do with her then, as it was his first one. He seemed so incredibly happy.\n\nI know that life must go on, but it’s just... never gonna be the way it was. He was so amazing. I never showed him how deeply I admired him.\n\nThere is nothing but a second between life and death. And it’s irreversible. I never thought that something like this could happen in my life... and yet here I am. I can’t comprehend any of it.\n\nWhile you can, make sure to always show everyone in your life how much you love them.\n\nEdit: I want to thank you all for the incredible amount of support. I’ve been reading all of the comments and messages. My father has as well. I am and will be returning to this post all of the time. I was unsure whether it was the right decision to write about this at first, but I am very glad I did. It’s good to know that the world cares. Thank You.",

      "body": "My (32F) brother (26M) was discharged from the Navy last month and my family threw a party to welcome him home. He is an extremely outgoing person and can make anyone smile and laugh. Because he was stationed on two aircraft carriers for basically 8 years he has only met my daughter a handful of times. My daughter (12F) is the quietest and shyest person you will ever met. Her father severely abused her as a child and she has extreme trust issues as a result. She only talks to me, her aunt, grandparents, and her best friend. I put her in therapy and she has been making progress but if you touch her in any way she might have a panic attack. Her social skills are fine but you need get her to trust you before she feels comfortable around you.\n\nI got her a Nintendo Switch for Christmas and she loves it. She is on it 24/7 and she considers it a safe space for her. She does her homework early so she has time to play it and takes it everywhere. She became a little too addicted to the Switch and I had to set some ground rules but she abides by them and we managed to figure out a healthy amount of time for her to play her games. She recently got into Mario Kart and is currently finding out about all the games in the franchise. My brother has a Wii and gave it to her and she reset the Mario Kart Wii game so she could unlock all the tracks and characters.\n\nMy brother was a HUGE Mario Kart fan as a kid. He had every game of the franchise and competed in online tournaments before he went into the Navy. I don’t know too much about the game but I remember him maxing out his account at 9999vr which I think is the highest level you can go.\n\nDuring the party my daughter was sitting next to my sister like usual when she told him her uncle is really into Mario Kart. I walked over and said she should ask him to play after the party but she shook her head. I pulled her aside and said my brother would not hurt a fly and he is one of the nicest people in the world. She agreed after I said I would be in the same room with them and after the party ended I asked my brother to play with my daughter and he said yes. She got her Switch and we sat at the table and 20 minutes later she was laughing and talking like I never saw her before. My brother was trash talking her and she was giving it back to him. They played for an hour before we left and my daughter was sad to see him leave. She told me he’s a lot of fun and wants to get to know him more.\n\nSince that day my daughter and brother have been spending a lot of time together and her personality has started to develop. She is talking more and is interacting with her classmates. Her English teacher emailed me to say my daughter volunteered to read a paragraph of the book they are reading and she barely stuttered while reading. She wants to try volleyball again in the fall and asked me to sign her up for tryouts. Yesterday she came home and said she played Mario Kart with a couple of her friends during recess and she asked them herself. She never reaches out to people so I was surprised. My brother has picked her up from school while I was at work a couple times and she finished her homework by the time I picked her up. I used to beg her to do her homework and now she willingly does it. She is breaking out of her shell and it makes me so happy to see. My brother has been a big part of it. He makes her do her homework then checks it and sees if it’s correct then they play Mario Kart or they play cards or he teaches her how to throw a ball. I am a little ashamed to say this but I kind of hope my brother builds a connection with her and she sees him as a positive male role model in her life. She certainly is not going to receive that from her father. Having my brother back home is awesome but seeing my daughter and her uncle connect warms my heart.",

But know it's very much appreciated and I'm so happy to hear many of you have friends like this in your lives <3\n\nShe was born in 1916 and I was born in 1992. I was 6 when I first met her in my neighborhood and loved to come over. Her husband died the year before I met her and she told me so many stories that I felt like I knew him. Her life was just as interesting and I adored hearing the things she did during her best years.\n\nWe'd play cards, listen to the radio, tell jokes, bake (and eat plenty of cookie dough). She wasn't like a grandmother to me, she was just a really good friend. I don't believe there are any pictures of us, but if there were then they have been lost in time.\n\nI moved houses, but stayed in the same town and could visit her at least once per week by riding my bike over. We moved a little further a few years later and the visits were a couple times per month with a few calls in between.\n\nI was 14 when a stranger called my house and asked for me. I never talked on the phone, so my mother was suspicious who it was. Once she asked, the woman on the phone introduced herself as the woman's grand-daughter. She was calling because her grandmother had passed and she wanted to let me know.\n\nI got a hug and then the subject never came up again. I missed my friend and people around me didn't think it mattered. I never knew why. Her family didn't even contact me for the service or anything. It hurt.\n\nI think about her every few months and everything comes flooding back. She gave me high expectations for a friend and I admit I've compared possible friends against her several times. I'm hoping that when travel restrictions are lifted, I can go to her grave. She buried next to her husband and love of her life. I can't wait to meet him.\n\nI guess I just miss my friend.",

      "body": "My boyfriend was at the gym with his brothers when he first called me to invite me to his house. Me, my boyfriend and his brothers have game night sometimes where we just play Mario kart and drink and i always look forward to it. Since he was still at the gym i told him to call me when they get home and i will head over. About 20 minutes later i get a call from him. Assuming he was calling to tell me he was on his way home i answered. I said hello like 5 times before i realized he couldn’t hear me. I think he might have accidentally dialed me from his call log. He was talking to his brothers about me though. He was telling them how a couple girls were hitting on him at the gym. The conversation goes like this, He said “i don’t have time for any gym hoes especially since i get to see my baby tonight.” He continues to say, “you don’t understand how crazy i am about her. She’s sweet, sexy, and i overall just cannot wait to see her.” He just goes on and on singing my praises. But the real reason i am making this post is because i heard something i wasn’t supposed to hear. My birthday is coming up and he’s been keeping my present a secret. A little bit about me, i am a photographer and while i work for a company right now i hope to one day start my own. He says “the camera she has now is a piece of shit (he’s not wrong) so I’m planning on getting her a canon with different lenses”(he didn’t specify the model) “I believe in her so much and i just want to see her succeed.” My boyfriend has no idea i heard this and I’ve been keeping it my little secret but i have been thinking about it since it happened. Im so giddy, i have never had someone feel this way about me and i just wanted to tell someone.\n\n\nEdit: first off thank you for all the upvotes and kind comments about my boyfriend. He really is a kind loving person and i love him so much. But secondly im noticing a lot of people saying “guys dont talk like that” and that the story is fake. and i lowkey thought yall would realize that i was paraphrasing a lot of what i heard. It was an Experience i had that i thought was worth sharing because I genuinely never had anyone think of me like that. Either way thank yall so much for the kind words.

I turned into a sobbing, heaving mess sitting in my car. How could I have been so selfish?\n\nI stayed there for another 30 minutes just trying compose myself.

I’m going to be marrying into an amazing family soon, and I just had to get it off my chest how ecstatic I am!!\n\n\nEdit: yeah i realize that not giving someone a heads up about being on speakerphone is kind of dumb move on our end, it’s just become a norm for us, but I’ll mention that to him tonight, thanks y’all ❤️",

      "body": "My name is Valkyrie Weather, born Kyle Cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director Rob Cohen (The fast and the Furious, xXx, and The Hurricane Heist among many others). When I was very young, Rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. My mother witnessed one of the assaults when I was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. This fact has cost me more than I could ever convey here. Rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. I know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote.  Presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, Rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in Thailand and The Czech Republic starting when I was as young as 13/14 years old. Through therapy and support from loved ones, I no longer feel that I owe this man any loyalty. And thanks to the #metoo movement, I have found the will to speak out. While Rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, I demand that my story be heard. I am not seeking financial restitution, nor do I have a career to promote. My greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by Rob Cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the silver and gold, it's truly humbling. However, instead of giving me more please send a donation to Trans Lifeline or the Joyful Heart Foundation. Thank you again.",

      "body": "So, yesterday my son turned 10. Awesome, he loves avengers so his dad &amp; I decide to throw him a party at the house. We invited family and friends who most of them RSVP'd. Great, we make enough food to feed 40+ people. The place looks awesome, avengers decorations everywhere, ballons, cupcakes, the whole nine yards. Only to have me &amp; my husband's immediate family be the only ones present. I'm talking 6 people max. Not another single kid at the birthday party. It broke my heart. My son kept looking out the window &amp; door for guests, asking when his friends will get here, but nobody ever came. I have a bag full of goodybags, a piñata still in tact, &amp; unopened games. People suck! Sucks we have a small family &amp; made my son feel like a loner on his freaking birthday!! He's a great kid &amp; has been looking forward to his birthday all year. But come on, how are you going to RSVP &amp; not come to a freaking kid's birthday party. \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Just wanted to give everyone a mini update. Omg I am overwhelmed by the Love &amp; wishes from the Reddit community, You guys are awesome!! I apologize if I wasn't able to respond to you individually but wow I came to this subreddit to vent &amp; all I got was a vast amount of support! You guys managed to make me cry again, hearing my son is not the only one &amp; there are many others who had similar experiences. I know it's just a birthday party but I try to do everything to see my son happy so when something like this happens I do feel helpless, it truly broke my heart. But you guys are willing to go above &amp; beyond &amp; make my little man's day special THANK YOU SO MUCH! You don't understand how much you are going to make some little kid's birthday the most memorable one by receiving cards from all around the world!! I know there are a lot of people who have asked, we are in Boston, MASS &amp; Monday morning I will go first thing to get a PO Box as I do not have one. His favorite characters are Iron Man &amp; Captain America. Thank you everybody. Will keep you updated. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I promise I haven't been ignoring you guys. My husband &amp; I spent the whole day yesterday with my son to lift his spirits, so I haven't had a chance to reply to most of you but will try to today. So I finally got a PO Box, thank you to all those who have made cards for my son. The amount of support is just unreal, me &amp; my husband can't thank you enough. \n\n\n\nGod bless you guys, honestly I can't thank you enough. I'm way too excited for him. We will explain to my son what is Reddit today when he gets home from school &amp; scroll through some comments. But we will leave the cards as a surprise. \n\n\nFINAL UPDATE: \nHi all! So I did try posting an update, &amp; it got deleted. So I'm posting it here. So to update you all on whats going on. We were finally able to go the post office, and I was in tears! You guys really outdid yourselves. Abe got so many cards &amp; packages. It was unreal. We are deeply moved by the love &amp; support you all have for a random little boy. That in itself speaks volumes. We sat down yesterday with Abe &amp; read \nevery single card. My son loved everythingg! He is so excited to have cards from all over the world, awesome comic books, &amp; toys. His mood has definitely changed, he's so much happier. &amp; This will definitely rewrite the bad birthday party he had. And we simply cannot thank you all enough for what you have done for me &amp; my family. This has turned out to be one of his best birthdays ever. &amp; it's all thanks to you Reddit! &lt;3",

      "body": "I was gang raped. It was brutal, and they took it in turns to cover my mouth so I couldn't scream. So when the pandemic hit, and masks started to be a thing, I didn't think I could do it. I got a letter of exemption from my psychiatrist, but it didn't sit right with me going out in a pandemic and not doing everything possible to protect myself and others. So I ordered some Harry Potter masks off of Etsy and started building it up. I'd wear a mask for five minutes at a time at home where I felt safe, and gradually moved this to ten minutes, then fifteen. If I started panicking, I'd bring up the reverse camera on my phone and remind myself that it was a Harry Potter themed piece of fabric covering my face. Geeky I know, but whatever works. During this time I didn't leave the house. Eventually, I started wearing one to go food shopping with my husband so he would be there if I had flashbacks or a panic attack.\nNow, I have a new job where I'm required to wear one throughout my shifts. Day in, day out. It's uncomfortable, it's hot and it makes my glasses steam up. But I do it.\nMy point is, I worked bloody hard to overcome that so that I'm doing my bit. It makes my blood boil that so many people aren't trying, or can't be arsed, with much flimsier excuses than my own.\nPlease don't get me wrong, I appreciate that some people with mental health conditions and other difficulties/disabilities etc will not be able to wear one. This is not aimed at you. But so many people who have no excuse are refusing to do what they can. There is a disease going round that is killing people. And it's not going to get any better unless we all put the effort in. Please wear a mask if you can.\n\n\nEDIT thank you for all the awards and kind words. And the messages offering advice on steamy glasses. I've also had a few messages from fellow PTSD sufferers saying that this has helped them and asking for further advice, which I'm so pleased about. Please feel free to message anytime if I can help in any way but remember everyone's journey is different and I don't claim to have all the answers.\n\nThe dickheads who have messaged me asking for explicit details of the assault can fuck off though. Including the delightful gentleman who offered to be my master now that I've been 'broken in'. Please never leave your mother's basement.",

Everything was fine up until they both left the room. My friend comes back and tells me that his coworker was expressing his interest in me. I was shocked as my relationship was public knowledge, but decided to play nice because I didn't want to make the situation awkward, thinking nothing would come of it as my friend was present. His coworker came back upstairs, and shortly after, my friend fell asleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe coworker then got close to me on the futon, trying to coax me into drinking the contents of the red solo cup in his hand. After trying to say no several times, I gave in. It didn't taste of too much alcohol. Shortly afterwards, I felt sick and decided to lay down. I only had two double shot drinks, and whatever was in his cup. He proceeded to put a fruit snack in his mouth and told me that eating the fruit snack would make me feel better. I started getting dizzy. Once again, I resisted, but after he put his face directly in front of mine, I obliged and tried to take the fruit snack from his mouth with my teeth as to not make contact. That's when he forced his lips on mine. I tried to get away, but realized I couldn't move my limbs. I was stuck. I tried to say no, but my slurred words had no effect. At that point, I knew what was going to happen and just tried to keep my eyes shut until it was over. He raped me. After he was done, he cuddled me as if he had done nothing wrong, stroking my hair and telling me he was going to take care of me. I passed out soon after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day my mother picked me up, and after she saw the choke marks on my neck, I broke down and told her I was raped. She tried to get me to go to the ER for a rape kit, but I was scared about missing work and trying to forget what had just occured. I tried to adjust back to normal life, but shortly afterwards was put in an intensive outpatient program and diagnosed with PTSD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time I had an ovarian cyst that needed monitoring via ultrasound. I went to my ultrasound appointment, which was exactly one month after the assault had happened. As the ultrasound was happening, I noticed a small circle on the screen, but thought nothing of it, thinking it might have been a blood clot as my period was a tad bit late. The technician finishes, and goes and phones the doctor. I didn't hear the conversation, but he came down and spoke with me. He asked if I was sure I wasn't sexually active. I cried and told him no but that I had just been raped. He informed me that the circle on my ultrasound might be an embryo and that I needed to take a urine pregnancy test. I called my partner after I provided my sample and wept. He kept me calm and assured me no matter what he would be there for me. The doctor came back in with a heavy face and broke the news to me. I was pregnant. I sobbed for what felt like ages. My mother and I left, and she told me she would stick by whatever decision I made. I already knew what I was going to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called Planned Parenthood and scheduled for a medical termination of my pregnancy. They told me scheduling would take two weeks, as I had to attend an informational meeting first. Those two weeks were the longest two weeks of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was terrified to go outside, convinced people would know about the dirty secret I was carrying in my womb. I was convinced the embryo was a parasite planted by my rapist to drain the life from me. There was not a second I was not in emotional distress. Every minute was torture, reliving what he did to me and feeling my body change in a response to what had been done. I had never experienced a level of body dysphoria like that. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror, or be nude for longer than 30 seconds at a time. I was rapidly switching between dissociation and flashbacks. The intensive outpatient program I was in refused to give me anything stronger for my anxiety, as it could damage the embryo, despite my begging and pleading and promising that I was absolutely certain I would terminate. It was a constant battle not to take my own life. I remember walking into Planned Parenthood, surrounded by people calling me a murderer. I told them I was raped, and they told me it was God's plan and that the abortion would be another trauma. I was livid, furious at these people for ignoring my state of distress in the name of their personal beliefs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went through with the abortion. It was painful, and sad, but in no way a trauma. This was my freedom from my rapist. This was reclaiming my body. This was being free. I am sad about it because this was not my choice. I never had a choice in this. This was the doing of my rapist, and what I did was the only way to save my life and reclaim some sense of normalcy. If I had been forced to go through with the pregnancy, I would have killed myself. Had it been a birth control failure, I would not have terminated, but that is my choice and my choice alone to continue my pregnancy. I can not make choices for other people, as pregnancy is different for every woman, and it is their choice to make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am extremely angry, shocked and disappointed at what is going on in Alabama. Women like me, women that are hurting, terrified, unready will not be able to get the procedure they need to be well. I am scared for them. I am scared for all women. These laws will strip us of our bodily autonomy, turning us into incubators for our predators. How many women will take their lives? How many women will die of unsafe abortions? This is the very definition of archaic. I've heard people say \"abortion is a trauma itself\", \"pregnancy is a blessing from God\", and \"but what about the child?\". I do not need anyone to speak for me. I am valid, and I will be heard. My termination was not a trauma, it was the first step in healing the wounds my rapist planted in my being. I do not want other people's religions dictating what happens with MY body. The embryo I terminated was just that, an embryo. It had no thoughts, no feelings. Had I continued the pregnancy, I would have died. If I had survived, the pregnancy would have destroyed my body, permanently scarring me and producing a baby that would be despised, unloved, and thrown into a system that repeatedly time and time again fails children. How is that a quality life for either of us? I am sick and tired of people dictating what women should do with their own bodies. Termination is a personal decision and is no one's business but the pregnant woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I had to relive that again, I would still make the same decision. My abortion saved my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your support, and for the reddit awards. I plan on responding to each and every one of your comments once I get off work. I love you all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Reddit wouldn't let me comment for an hour or so, so I've responded to what I can for tonight and I will continue responding to comments tomorrow. You are all in my thoughts, and I am so thankful for your support. My PMs are open to all who need a shoulder to lean on, or even just a friendly conversation. Making this post is probably one of the best things I've done for my healing, and I've learned a very valuable lesson. Despite how loud ignorance can be, love and compassion will always be louder. Carry that love with you and share it with others. Goodnight, and I hope you all have a wonderful day.",

I told him per company/state policy, and he just looked at me and said \"okay\" as he proceeded to continue about his business. I kinda throw up my hands in a \"well fuck\" fashion and throw him back his \"okay.\" He asks me \"Well do you want to get my groceries for me then?\" And just walks off.\n\nWe stare daggers at one another as he's shopping, and I'm full ready to go off on this guy at the counter since my last day is tomorrow anyway. Then he does something I wasn't expecting, he grabbed a pack of disposable masks.\n\nThe first thing he says to me is \"Man, I'm sorry for being rude. You're just trying to do your job, and the Lord knows I wouldn't want to be the guy to tell all these people to wear a mask. I'm just not used to it is all, I hope you can bear with me.\" I tell ya, he almost made a grown ass 20 year old sob tonight with just one sentence. Too many times I've had people brush me off, get rude and loud in the store, and just generally act shitty. It was such a small but so impactful act of humanity that I haven't been treated to since I started working here. It was refreshing. There's still hope.",

      "body": "So my friend and I met in elementary school, we were close. As we got out of high school he joined the army and did his thing while I did mine but we kept in contact. After he left the military, I even drove 900 miles and picked him up from base. \n\nWe lived together for a long time as roommates and just lived our life. Played video games mostly, we were both kinda losers tbh lol.\n\nA few years ago I was getting married and ultimately moved out and he was in a relationship with a girl and they moved in together. Him and his girl got married and they had a son together last July. My wife and I had a daughter this past December. \n\nWe hadn’t talked in a while. Lives were just kinda going different directions and with kids it’s hard. I distanced myself from him just because he was still rather lazy and I just wanted to keep focused and not let that affect me.\n\nHis wife has 3 kids from before they got married. I found out he was caught in the act molesting their 11 year old. After that he barricaded himself in the garage with his gun before surrendering to the police. He is currently in custody with multiple felony charges, and I guess this had been going on for a while.\n\nI knew this person better than anyone. I lived with him for years. If there was anyone on this earth I trusted it would be him. How does this happen?\n\nI can’t wrap my head around it. What did I miss? I just feel after this like who can you trust? There was never an indication he had any issues whatsoever and that’s what kills me. How can people be so normal yet be so deranged and do these things. \n\nIf anyone has any idea as to what goes on in the mind of the types of people it might help me get a better understanding of how the hell that happened. I am just so shocked and disgusted. Thank you for hearing it out :)",

      "body": "Oy. This is bugging me. A few days ago I pulled an old cookbook out I had gotten when I used to live in Melbourne OZ and flipped to my favourite recipe. Yes I thought. I haven’t made this in ages. I went out and got the ingredients and last night started chopping and cooking. My husband is in a state of glee. “You are making dinner?? Reeealllly??” He was so happy. A little too happy. I was about to playfully give him shit when it hit me like a freight train: I hadn’t cooked us dinner in six months. COVID hit right before I was going to take this intense life-overtaking course (which wound up being online of course) and I lost my job. I focused on the work and made myself crazy with it, spending 12-14 hours on my laptop everyday. Once I graduated I launched into another course with similar workload. Because of all of this I have been living a rather subhuman life: endless days in pjs, not seeing people enough due to the rona, questioning my self worth, takeout on takeout on takeout, fits of rage and depression. You know the deal as mannnnnnnnyyyyy of you can relate. \n\nAnyways, I love my husband. He’s so great. He does so much for me and with his goofy smile and little pet names, I don’t know what I would do without him. But holy fuck I need to learn balance. I can’t just bury my head and let him do the rest. So today is going to be different. Today I strive for balance and a small way to show my appreciation. Today I will be better.\n\nEDIT: Wow. So thanks for all the awards and nice comments. I’m sorry for the people who felt they had to message me horrible things. I’m sorry your life is so sad that you need to lash out in that way. Life has clearly been kinder to me. But to the vast majority of you: HUGS. You make me feel better about humanity too.",

      "body": "I'm a married man with young kids. I live a boring life, office job, don't smoke or do drugs, normally. But I have one secret. When my wife and kids are away for the weekend I take xtc. I watch porn for hours on end and dildo myself silly. Got a bunch of vibrators and dildos of various sizes, pants with holes at the crotch and anus, various fleshlights, cigarettes and a small bag with a bunch of pills, all stuffed away in a big shoppingbag in our basement. It's in a far corner, just behind some personal stuff and old skiwear I no longer use.\n\nIt's safe there because my wife is scared of the shaky steep stairs and in general scared of the basement (dark, spooky). Went there once or twice and was like \"nope, you have to get things from me there I ain't going there\". And if she needs something she always asks me.\n\nSo this weekend I'm out of town and I get a text: \"why do you keep that old skisuit? You don't use it and it's old\" My heart starts pounding like crazy: why is she in the basement? And apparently she's in that very corner? I say \"yeah, well maybe one day again.. wow you're in the basement!?\" Her: \"yeah I needed a thing and once here it wasn't so bad and now I want to sort some of this trash out\". Heart rate increases but I don't know anything I could do from here, far away, and saying \"don't do that\" would be super suspicious. So I just answer that I applaud her bravery and that I was going to clean as well (implying she doesn't need to do this). \n\nI didn't get another message so I figured she didn't find it. Because she would definitely call me right away if she even just found a dildo, nevermind everything else I had there. \n\nWhen I come home all seems normal and as soon as I can I check in the basement and see the skiwear bag on the same place. Behind it my bag full of sex and drugs stuff, untouched. Deep sigh of relief. Apparently she just for some reason didn't open the bag after the skiwear. I'm sweating while typing this.",

      "body": "I went to a deli around midnight last night for food. I see this really young girl (she’s maybe 21 or 22) who is incredibly intoxicated. She can’t even stand up. I look over and I see this creepy delivery guy, who is in his late 50s or 60s, literally telling her “let me take you somewhere to feel better.” He keeps trying to give her something she does not want. I’m too far away to see what it is. Moments later, he sits her down in a chair and is clearly trying to coax her into leaving with him. I call the police and they claim they’ll be there soon. 10 minutes pass and no one arrives.\n\nI go outside, and all of a sudden, I see this guy HOLDING HER UP and dragging her through the streets of New York. He is aggressively making out with her and she has no idea where she is.\n\nI called the police again to no avail. I follow them and finally, the guy gets to his apartment and I had to intervene. I asked him if he knows this girl. He gets startled and backs away. She grabs me for a drunk hug. The guy panics and says he is the police, then changes his story to that’s his sister. He reaches in his pocket to make it seem like he had a badge or gun. I completely ignore it because adrenaline had taken over at this point. I wasn't going to let this POS intimidate me. I asked the girl if she knew this dude or if she knew where she was, and she says no, they were going to have a “fun time.” I then asked her if she wanted that and she told me no, she just wanted to go home. I snatched the girl’s stuff from his hands and we walk away. The loser pulls out his phone to record us. I suspect he was going to flip and say I was the one harming her.\n\nWe go into a bodega down the street to kill time. She is a mess — crying and saying she wants to call her dog to pick her up. The bodega owner steps in to keep her calm. That’s how drunk she was. A small crowd gathers inside the store because no one knows what’s going on. Luckily, a bystander intervened because he saw the fucking loser STILL lurking outside waiting for her to leave. This idiot finally comes in the store and acts as if he knows her. The police show up (after 20 - 30 minutes) and questions him. He can’t keep track of his lies, so they kick him out and warn him to stay away from her. The police eventually orders her an Uber from her phone to send her home.\n\nI am a little shaken up by it. I know it’s 2025, but I cannot believe this guy was going to sexually assault this girl if I had not intervened. The one thing that still bothers me were the cops telling me afterwards that it was no big deal because people get drunk all the time in the city. Yet they thanked me anyway. No, this was going to be rape. Blatant rape.\n\nI feel like I fucked up because this guy has footage of me and I don’t have footage of him. I don’t know. I guess I’m venting at this point. I feel like this should not be traumatic for me in any way, but I’ve been thinking about it ever since. So fucked up, man.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. It truly means a lot.",

      "body": "Hi. I’m 23M, and this week my entire life changed.\n\nThree days ago, my grandfather passed away. He was 78. He had two kids: my mom and my uncle. I’m the youngest in our family, or at least I thought I was.\n\nMy family is very big.\n\nDuring the wake, a huge bomb dropped on all of us. It turns out my grandfather had a four year old daughter. With a cleaning lady who used to help him around the house. The woman is gone and no one knows where she went. The girl’s name is Lenka, and she’s tiny, quiet, and completely alone. And everyone in my family hates her.\n\nAt the funeral, nobody would even look at her. I saw her curled up in the corner of the room, like she was trying to disappear. And the only conversation anyone had was who’s NOT going to take her. They all agreed she should be sent to an orphanage.\n\nI don’t know what happened to me at that moment, but I snapped. I walked over to her, knelt down, smiled, and asked, Would you like to live with me?  \nShe didn’t say anything. Just slowly nodded. And that was it.\n\nThat night, Lenka came home with me. She had been staying with my cousin for a few days, and Nika handed me her health card and basically said good luck. I’m a 23-year old guy living alone in a small apartment in eastern Slovakia. I work from home. I pay rent. I’m not rich. I’ve never raised a child. I’m still an external university student. I go to school on weekends. But she came with me. And she’s been here since.\n\nThat night she didn’t say a word on the car ride. I showed her my apartment, gave her food. She barely reacted. Later that night, while I was trying to sleep… I broke. It was 2 a.m. and I was crying like I haven’t cried in years.\n\nI kept thinking: What the hell am I doing?  \nHow can I raise a child when I’m just a kid myself?  \nMy family won’t help. Everyone will judge me. She’s not even technically my niece she’s my aunt.\n\n(Yeah. That part’s wild. She’s my mom’s half-sister. Which makes her my aunt. But she’s 4.)\n\nI couldn’t sleep at all that night. Around 3am we had a little accident, she wet the bed. She didn’t cry. She just tried to hide the blanket like she didn’t want me to find out. My heart cracked in half. I told her everything’s okay and helped her clean up.\n\nIn the morning, I explained we needed to go shopping for her things. We walked to the store only 5 minutes away, but it took us 15. She was trying to be independent and didn’t want to hold my hand. But on the way back, she was so tired she almost collapsed on the sidewalk. I asked if I could carry her, and she said no at first but after a few more steps, I picked her up anyway. She looked annoyed, but didn’t resist. We made it home.\n\nI made her breakfast (thank you to the friend who gave me ideas), then told her we had to go to some offices so I could become her guardian.\n\nI thought I’d just drop off the papers. Instead, the whole process started immediately.\n\nIt was chaos. I brought every document I had, my ID, death certificate, her health card, a letter I wrote asking for emergency temporary custody. But when I got to the child services office (ÚPSVaR), one woman… tore me apart.\n\nShe was cold and cruel and basically called me a stupid boy to my face.  \nYou’re just a kid.  \nYou can’t raise another kid.  \nYou don’t even have rights to her.  \nShe’s better off with her mother.\n\nAnd she said all of this in front of Lenka, who was sitting quietly in my lap.\n\nI looked down and saw tears running down her face. At first, I didn’t even notice just felt her little body trembling. She was crying silently.\n\nI gently apologized to the woman, stood up, and said we’d come back later. I took Lenka outside and walked her to a little ice cream shop nearby. We sat together in silence. I explained we’d have to go back and talk to the mean lady, but I promised I’d stay with her the whole time. She nodded.\n\nBack inside, the woman didn’t get any nicer, but she did explain what would happen next. Basically exactly what I had read online: social workers will visit us. They'll try to contact her mother. If they find her, she may get legal priority. But I’m going to fight this. Because if that woman abandoned Lenka once, she’ll do it again. And I won’t let that happen.\n\nNow it’s late again. I’m completely drained. And I need to say this somewhere: I love this kid.  \nI’ve known her for three days and I’d do anything to protect her.  \nBut I’m falling apart inside.\n\nI work from home, which is the only reason this is even possible. But on weekends I go to university, and I’ll probably have to give that up. There's no babysitting culture here in Slovakia, especially not in a small town like ours.\n\nI’m selling my motorcycle so I’ll have more money for her.  \nI’m terrified I’ll never find a girlfriend because what 23 year old wants a boyfriend with a 4 year old?\n\nI feel like I traded everything I used to be… for someone who deserves a better life. And I don’t regret it.\n\nBut I’m scared. And tired. And trying not to break.  \nI don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just needed to let it out.\n\nIf you read all this… thank you. Really.  \nAnd if anyone’s been through something similar any advice would mean the world.",

      "body": "Last night my (22M) friend (21M) came over to play video games. We were in the living room when my sister (13) came out of her room and walked into the kitchen to refill her water bottle. She was wearing spandex shorts and a tank top and it looked like she was working out. After she went back to her room my friend leaned over and said her spandex looked good on her and said her body is beginning to fill in nicely. I gave him a look and said it was just his opinion but she looked hot when she walked past us. I couldn’t tell if he was joking but regardless I turned off the game and asked him to leave. He was confused and I got in his face and told him not to speak about my sister like that. He tried saying it was a joke but I don’t see how those statements are jokes. He left without saying anything else then texted me a couple hours later telling me to chill out. I am not going to chill out over a 21 year old calling my sister’s body hot and complimenting her abs. He said I’m overreacting but I don’t think I am. I’m thinking about ending our friendship right now. I am disgusted. I don’t feel comfortable around him anymore.\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up. I wrote this at 2am then fell asleep. Thank you everyone for the support. I unfollowed him on social media and removed his number from my phone. This morning my mom asked me if he came over and I said he did but asked him to leave after he made some inappropriate comments about my sister. She immediately got the message and said she does not want him anywhere near our apartment. I feel bad for putting my sister and my mom in this spot but I’m glad he showed his true colors. I feel like I could do more though.",

Much later, we were all outside watching me and my buddy play pong. My girlfriend tells me that she feels sick and says she’s going upstairs to the bathroom. The game had gotten pretty exciting so I told her I would come up when it was over. One friend (calling him Joe) went inside to get a drink. A few minutes later I could hear my girl yelling my name. I thought she just wanted a drink or sum so i sent two of my friends to go check on her as i was still playing. Then we are hear loud yelling and hear crashing sounds. We all go downstairs and see joe lying on the ground with one of the guys hovering over him. The other is holding my girlfriend in a blanket. They told me what happened. Joe had found my girl in the bathroom and got on top of her. They said they saw him trying to pull her clothes off while she cried. He got her top off and almost her bottoms. They pulled him off and ig beat the fuck out of him based on his face. I feel an endless amount of guilt for this night. I could have stopped it if I had just stopped my game. My girlfriend is terrified to be around Joe and never wants to drink again. I’ll hate myself forever for this.",

      "body": "Three weeks ago, we were paycheck to paycheck. Our bank accounts were always empty. We survived on my husbands (40/m) job and my (34/f) disability. We have kids.\n\nAlso, at the same time, I was experiencing a terrible cyst on my neck that was leaving me bed bound in excruciating pain but the surgery was going to be $8,000 cash, out of pocket, because Medicare only covers 80%.\n\nSo on the day of seeing a specialist, my husband took the day off work to go with me. At 7 am, his boss called.\n\nHe was being placed on paid leaving, pending an investigation, into a mistake he made at work. Nothing too bad, a technical error, but still an error.\n\nWe both panicked. We have been slowly working our way out of poverty for 8 years.. we were so close to being ok and it was all falling away. \n\nWe decided to stay positive and just hope for the best. He was a great employee so we thought he would just be written up.\n\nTwo days later he checked our bank account for something and found that they had deposited his last check and vacation time. He received the official phone call later in the afternoon.\n\nWe were devastated. He cried. We panicked. His last bought of unemployment was 5 months, before that was 2 years. We have no savings account and barely have enough income to pay the bills, but make too much money for any financial assistance.\n\nBut we lost our main income. And it was terrifying.\n\nSo the next day we gathered our records and went to the welfare office. We had enough money to pay some outstanding bills but the future was uncertain.\n\nThe worst part? Long story short, he can’t collect unemployment for 8 weeks (separate issue, but still stands).\n\nSo he had the possibility of having $0 income for two months. We were absolutely panicking.\n\nBut we applied for food stamps and Medicaid. \n\nThen, we dove into job applications and he sent out resumes to everywhere in the field. He came across some promising companies.\n\nNow, with exactly $0, only enough food to last for about a week, no gas and a good dose of situational depression, we worked together and crossed our fingers.\n\nThe next day, he got an email invitation for a phone interview.\n\nAnd I got a phone call, my neck surgery was going to be free now that we were poor again. \n\nHe did the phone interview, the interviewer said that he was a great candidate. A week later he had a video interview and it went great.\n\nHe got the job. :-) \n\nThey are going to be paying him $3 more an hour than his last job and there is more room for growth. \n\nSo we are actually going to be able to afford our bills and like, buy food and pay for medicine. He went from employed but broke to unemployed and screwed to now employed with a better job than before.\n\nAnd I get to have my surgery. Hooray!\n\nHe doesn’t start for two weeks so we are going to spend some quality time together because life is short and he is probably going to go back to working 50 hours a week.\n\nBut whew, what a roller coaster ride!",

      "body": "I expect this will get downvoted into oblivion but I want to share this, and for the last time. Being open about my experience has caused me nothing but pain and loss.\n\nI'm a father and recently divorced, dating again... or was. After a failed loveless marriage was clearly dead end, I took steps to lose weight and get healthy. My love life prior had been sparse and I dated what I could get, including a short empty marriage and a the aforementioned loveless one. I was not longer morbidly obese and for the first time seen as genuinely attractive by a lot of women.\n\nA small piece of background detail, I was physically abused as a child viciously. Yeah, I know a lot of people were. I was also molested by my mother, a very toxic and damaged person. This is also something I won't be sharing again either as most have attacked me over their need to never believe a mother could do such a thing. Obviously, my ability to feel trust and comfortable around women was damaged. This becomes key later.\n\nI dated a lot of women, even went to therapy again. I had a couple short term relationships, and had finally reached a point when I was truly able to open my heart, trust and love freely. I felt strong and secure. \n\nThen I met her.\n\nWe had amazing chemistry from the start and kissing her was amazing on our second date. The third date was fun too, and we fooled around a little, but something felt off so not much more. We made plans to meet the next night.\n\nI came over and we talked. I opened up about some of my past issues, hoping that being completely open would ease my own last lingering doubts. She became cold, and tore me apart, emotionally, emasculating and humiliating me until I was to the point of tears. I never felt so small and worthless in my life. \n\nShe then climbed on top of me and raped me. I did not consent to it. I said no. She didn't care, I was a piece of meat to her. My body betrayed me and responded, but I was dying inside, repulsed and violated. Afterwards, she was done with me, and I left. I vomited outside of her apartment, went home. I cried that whole night and didn't sleep until dawn.\n\nI reached out to friends, but was thought to be lying, or a loser. A couple of female friends became furious with me as they had really been raped, but men can't be. Obviously I was unstable as why hadn't I enjoyed it? One by one I watched most of my relationships crumble or be damaged. Last night, my best friend and I parted ways. Things haven't been the same since that happened to me, after all I was supposed to be the strong friend she replied on.\n\nMen aren't allowed to be raped or molested and talk about it. We are laughed at and derided. Just stop being a wimp and get over it.\n\nI'm writing this because I'm tired of having to explain myself anymore, having to validate that it really happened to me. I'm tired of the jokes, the loss of respect. I don't date anymore, as I see every woman as another possible predator. I'm also tired of trembling when I hug a new woman for the first time.\n\nIt's time to bury this all down deep, along with the heart I feel I can no longer share. I'm just damaged goods now.\n\nEDIT: I really didn't expect anyone to read this. Thank you for the very positive (mostly) responses and messages. Thank you so much for the gold and silver.\n\nI am in therapy and \"doing the work\". I'm just not going to share this with others. What my mother did was something neither wife could accept, and judging on some comments here and some \"lovely\" PMs, many can't understand how what happened to to me was possible a few months back.\n\nI looked into prosecution, but despite living in a liberal state, I live in a conservative town, and they would do nothing. She also has a friend on the force. Getting ridiculed by the police isn't going to help me.\n\nI do have an ex girlfriend that is there for me. She is literally the only woman that I can be touched by. She knows and is supportive. It helps on the rare occasions our schedules cooperate. We aren't compatible as partners, but being held sometimes by someone I do trust really helps.\n\nI'm just going it one day at a time, putting on the fake smile and living as best as I can. I'm working to be able to trust again, but it will be a long time.\n\nEDIT 2: I am overwhelmed. My whole life has been rejection and pain, to pull myself up and get knocked down again by this event I wrote about. Thank for the platinum, golds and silvers. Thank you for seeing me. Thank you each and every one of you. I don't feel brave, just honest. Over 5000 people see me, and hundreds have reached out.\n\nThank you doesn't even cover it. The world feels a little less cold today.\n\nFINAL EDIT (2019-02-19): Thank you for all the support. I wrote this post to just put it out there one last time, and then pretend it never happened and try to move on. I am pleased that it meant so much to so many people, and so many reached out. I'm going to do my best to heal from this and move on in a positive way. I never thought more that 7500 people would care, as I didn't think anyone would, or even see my post.\n\nTo answer a couple last questions in comments.\n\nI did freeze, which is why I didn't throw her off. In the back of my head I still had the notion of not wanting to hurt a woman. Obviously, I would have acted differently if I realized what was happening. I was raped. I don't really care if you believe it, but it happened.\n\nAlso, to the ugly and hateful comments that have started appearing in my inbox. I couldn't care less about karma or attention. I didn't do this for that. I did that to cry out one last time and then remain silent. I didn't expect this response and it's given me a sense of validation I never expected. I'm sorry that a few of you want me to kill myself and delete this post. I'm sorry that a few of you call me insulting and degrading terms. I have given out all the Reddit coins to people who posted elsewhere for people like me. I'm not letting you bring me down, nor am I deleting this post. I want what I went through to be known for the next guy that has the same thing happen, and all of the wonderful, supportive and even loving comments I received to be shared.\n\nTo prove I don't care about my karma, I'm deleting my account, to silence those ugly, cowardly voices that lurk in hateful private messages.\n\nThank you again, to the vast majority of you. I will never forget how whole and seen you helped a broken man feel.",

      "body": "I work in an \"old person\" home. \n\nThere are many people here who haven't recognized their family members for over a decade. There are people here who scream and cry every day in confusion and misery.  There are people that are so depressed they won't talk.\n\nAnd for this honor? People are paying tens of thousands of dollars a year. Some even more. \n\nFrom a humanitarian perspective - this is insane.  Unnaturally prolonging life  to squeeze as many miserable days out of the body as you can. \n\nChristians who argue that these people must be kept alive to not interfere with god's will drive me insane. Tell me what is \"natural\" about feeding someone through tubes and dosing them up with 50 pills a day? How is that more natural then, you know..... naturally letting someone die. My god, I don't understand religious people. \n\nFaith teaches mercy and to not be cruel. How people can \"study\" for their entire lives and arrive at the conclusion that keeping someone alive in these circumstances is the right answer is beyond me.\n\nFrom the financial perspective - I don't even see how this is an issue. This is a horrible, horrible, horrible waste of resources. The cost to keep one person, who doesn't even know where they are, alive for 1 year could house and feed a family of four for a year.\n\nDon't tell me there's no money for mental health services.

      "body": "Throwaway, absolutely.\n\nIt was the best decision I ever made. My now ex-boyfriend was emotionally and verbally abusive. He’d call me derogatory names when I didn’t do something he wanted and he’d make hurtful comments about my body. I’m not even overweight but I have body dysphoria.  I was crying every single day. I wanted to leave him but I couldn’t because i was emotionally dependent on him for everything and we were living together. He started going to strip clubs and being open with me about and telling me he enjoys seeing women that look better than me. He went so often that I felt like he was cheating on me. I just had to go for myself and see what it was like.\n\nOne night I went and decided to pay for a dance. It just so happens the I got a dance from one of the strippers he sees. Little did I know meeting her was going to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was a bit drunk and tipsy so I over shared with her about my bf and told her about him. She said she knew who I was talking about because he’d always talk badly about me to the dancers. I just broke down and cried right there like a big idiot in front of her. She gave me a tissue to wipe my tears and gave me a huge hug. She said she didn’t know what my bf was talking about because she thought I was beautiful. It made me cry even more because it made my day for a girl to think I’m pretty at least. \n\nI kept going every so often then eventually we exchanged numbers and started going out. I was so surprised to see she dressed like a boy when she wasn’t working and to learn that she was gay. She told me she doesn’t like men at all but she makes good money off of them. People really surprise me a lot. She had/has the cutest personality ever. She opens doors for me and would ask me if I was tired or if I had anything to eat. I realized I was attracted to her and she was attracted to me. This kept going on for a few months.  One night she kissed me and told me to leave him and to move in with her. We had sex and she made me look at myself in the mirror and tell myself I’m beautiful. I thought it was time to leave him because at that point I realized I deserved better than to be emotionally, mentally and verbally abused almost everyday by someone I used to love.\n\nWhile he was at work she helped me pack up everything. I sent him a text detailing why I was leaving him. I changed my number and blocked him on everything. I live with her far away from him and haven’t heard from him in months and honestly I’m glad.  \n\nI don’t care about your opinions on my cheating on my abusive boyfriend. I have no regrets. If I never cheated on him I would’ve never found the power to leave his toxic and abusive ass and be with a girl who loves all of me and makes me feel so beautiful. \n\nWe’ve been together for six months and I’m still so in love with her. She’s still the same loving and sweet person she was when I first met her. And she’s amazing in bed, like full blown amazing. She makes me cum all the time and he hardly ever did. Maybe only once a month if I’m being honest. She works at a different strip club now and I found a new job I’m starting soon and I’m so excited for new shit to come my way. I feel so blessed and lucky.\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day everyone :) If you don’t have a valentine it doesn’t matter just love yourself ❤️\n\n\nEdit: ok so I didn’t “just go lesbian”.  Bisexuality exists for all you ignorant assholes commenting about my sexuality. \n\nI don’t care if you think my experience was “fake” or not. Bottom line is I’m in a happy relationship.\n\nThanks everybody for the awards and the kind comments! :) HOLY SHIT THIS REALLY BLEW UP\n\nEdit 2: Lots of comments asking if they see each other at the club. I already stated my gf works at a different club now so no they don’t!\n\n\nEdit 3: I didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did! HOLY CRAP THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HAPPY HEART ♥️ 🥰😘",
